How the Pokémon anime SHOULD have been rebooted,0,zphl5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zphl5l/how_the_pokémon_anime_should_have_been_rebooted/,3,1671423212.0,"We all know Ash Ketchum is going to leave the anime and is being repleaced by 2 new protagonists, but will this even work? 
First of all the new protags seem to be children so the anime will brush up on similar ideas and stories that Ash went through during his time as the lead.
Anyways I think it would be really cool if the writers decided to target a slightly older audience such as teenagers and young adults rather than children and make the anime more serious with consequence and with a strong storyline. Such as how Yu-gi-oh redbooted with Yu-gi-oh GX which was a good reboot.
My ideas for a story would be to either time skip Ash Ketchum into the future about 5 years or bring in a more older character around the age of 15-18. Their goal would be to defeat the various Teams across all the regions with some new villains as well but this time make the story arc more serious and more focused upon. Team Rocket can become more dangerous this time around and cause major problems for Ash and he can finally take on Giovanni properly and defeat him during the final arc.
An example of new villains I thought of is based in the Sinnoh region where an organisation called the Dark Legion try to capture Darkrai and their objective is to use its power to alter the types of other Pokémon and make them pure Dark types. This can encourage some really amazing storylines and action. A similar battle to the final fight in the XYZ series can occur with everyone from the Sinnoh region combining to defeat an army of Dark type Pokémon where Ash will destroy the leader of the organisation and free Darkrai. There could even pssibly be some deaths for some characters to set the tone right.
That'a my take on the Pokémon anime. Its probabaly a bit messy but I thought I could just put my opinion in and let others know about the true potential that the Pokémon anime has. Let me know what you guys think too!",2022-12-19 06:13:32

Not Sold They Are Getting Rid Of Ash/Pikachu. Thoughts On Ash/Pikachu's Final Chapter.,1,zpd5ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zpd5ve/not_sold_they_are_getting_rid_of_ashpikachu/,8,1671410336.0,"Now, I will be the first to say that I am not completely onboard with them getting rid of Ash/Pikachu from the series, but I do understand why some want to see a new direction. For me, I want to see the franchise continue so that future generations can enjoy it and make sure it does not drift off into obscurity

First, I think it would hard for them to completely write Ash and (more importantly) Pikachu out. Too much money has been spent over the years promoting them as the face of the franchise (look at their avatars for platforms like YouTube, Twitter, or even the recent World Championships). So cutting ties would mean they have to start over.

I could see this posing two issues. One is if they have new protagonists each generation, I don't know if people will have the same connection or get as invested in the characters because they know they will be gone after a few seasons. The second thing depends on what the new characters goals are. If it is that her path is the same as Ash/Pikachu's, I wonder if people will still get as invested because it would be a similar arc that has already been done.

So, I am wondering if they will leave ""The Final Chapter"" open ended somehow to give the possibility of a return. Just incase these new characters cause a drop in viewership/sales. Or if these episodes will be setting up another component to what it means for Ash to be a Pokemon Master. He's already become the strongest trainer and completed that part, but is there another aspect of his goal that could be developed in future generations.

Also, they generally have 3 characters that travel around each region. So unless they are changing up the formula to only two, there might be a spot for a third.

I would be interested to hear your thoughts!",2022-12-19 02:38:56

So here's what you need to do.

1: Three other friends and a way to coordinate outside the game(you -can- do this with randos but it's not as successful without a plan)
 
2: Have one friend run Umbrion Max HP and Speed with both screens and Fake tears. Have one friend Run the FM build, Have another Friend run Blissy with Helping Hands, Both Screens, and Life Dew. Get a Pixelate Sylveon with Fake Tears, Hyper Beam, Calm Mind, and Hyper Voice.

3: Turn 1: Umbrion/Blissy (either one) sets up light screen, Sylveon Does Calm mind. FM can do helping hands/fake tears (preferibly fake tears). Sylveon will use Calm Mind on the next turn as well. Blissy uses the life dew, FM/Umbrion use fake tears.

4: Turn 3: Other members use helping hand/Attack Buff Cheer, Sylveon uses Hyper Beam. Prepare to wheeze if Hyper beam misses (if this happens just use Hyper beam next turn) this will 100% One Shot Zard every time.

I have tested this, with some discord friends and I think some randos have sorta figured it out (I see some people bringing sylveon but not the other pieces of the puzzle) but nobody wants to cooperate with randoms.

So I'm pretty sure that S/V the third Legendary is a new form of Zygarde,0,zpbmis,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zpbmis/so_im_pretty_sure_that_sv_the_third_legendary_is/,10,1671406096.0,"This is primarily just speculation based on my own experience in game dev, and story telling.

With that said I'm pretty sure that third major legendary that is acting as the Eternatus , Necrozma equivlant, that is connected to this games major mechanic is either Zygarde or some new paradox form of such.

For starters what we know about the new mon is that it is a disk (most likely a sphere going by the picture) made of overlapping Hexagons.  These hexagons appear to be what is in the Tera orb and what causes Terastiliazations, and can be found on the rims on each tera crown with a pronounce set of eyes.

Appearing to be alive in some way.

This is very similar to zygarde a pokemon that is very much a being made of overlapping Hexagons, that each hexagon or another words core is very much it's own individual living being. That comes together to form multiple different forms.

Zygarde is a Pokémon introduced in Kalos the neighboring country of Paldea, who is also a mon that never quite got it's own story. As their was never a Z-version to flesh out their role in the games. He is also a pokemon that game freak has kept alive going out of their way to include him in the last three major titles. So he is someone the devs would rather you not forget about.

And considering that the theme for Area zero is very much entities pulled out of their time. This third legendary could very much be some version of zygarde pulled from some distance period of time. Ethier acting as some long lost form, or future evolution. Possible even both as different cores come together from different time periods to form something new altogether.

Or if you want to pull from Kalos this could be the result of the blast from the ultimate weapon. This crator has been their for a long while, and would have been caused by some form of impact from up above. Much like mega stones being radiated evolution stones do the likes of the X/Y legendaries, this third legendary could be that equivalent of radiated zygarde cells from the blast.

That I would also like to point out the weird disconnect between terastiliztion and the time bending aspest of area zero. They really don't seem to connect to each other much. The paradox pokemon were not terastilized or changed by such an effect, in the same way that titan pokemon and the herbamystica had no real relations to such either.

It feels like that their are multiple elements at play pulling on each other or coming from a different source all together then whatever this legendary is doing by it's self. Something that set off all these different elements. Regardless if it was the impact of the blast ultimate weapon or not.",2022-12-19 01:28:16

Team-building Idea,2,zpb4c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zpb4c6/teambuilding_idea/,0,1671404724.0,"I tried this one out on my hacked switch. It's easier to set up with save edits. But I may try it out for real for a post-game team.

If I have a pokemon, like, say, Garchomp... and it knows Tera Blast... and it's Tera type is a type other than dragon or ground... I can have it behave like a completely different pokemon, defensively and offensively. Like a mono fire type.

In this way, I can technically have all 18 types on a single team, by not overlapping types once. And each Tera type being one not already used.

I tested it out with the following team...

Gholdengo - Ghost/Steel (Normal)

Tyranitar - Rock/Dark (Flying)

Toxicroak - Poison/Fighting (Bug)

Garchomp - Dragon/Ground (Ice)

Azumarill - Water/Fairy (Psychic)

Scovillain - Grass/Fire (Electric)


A quick rundown of how this went in practice...

Having access to all types like that made me think in a way I didn't have to before. Instead of just clicking the super effective button, I was constantly thinking... do I terastallize now to get a stab move that's super effective, or run with who I have now? When I terastallize, offensively I lose 5 types. Defensively, I lose 6, and change 1. I was constantly thinking about what types I could afford to lose.

The team itself is important. Because whatever types they are, offensively I'll never lose those ones. It's still very worthwhile to have grass/fire/water. Defensively, you need to know that you'll be out for a bit before terastallizing. Which does matter. If I'm a Heracross, the opponent will most likely try a flying type move. But if Heracross's Tera type is grass, it'll still be super effective. You're better off giving heracross a rock or a steel Tera type.

It's also difficult to do moves with these pokemon.

You need a STAB for both your regular types... a slot for Tera Blast, and... only one is left for whatever you want. And considering that you'll most likely stick to stab moves, PP becomes more valuable. As well as accuracy. Not by a lot, but enough to maybe reconsider some choices.

It's a very viable team build. But it's not without its flaws, and it requires very specific raising of your pokemon.

I wanted to put the idea out there to see what people think. Maybe people can build off the idea?",2022-12-19 01:05:24

Phoebe is a great character,7,zpafsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zpafsb/phoebe_is_a_great_character/,6,1671402919.0,"While editing this rival analysis video, I'm noticing I'd said I liked Phoebe more than Acerola. I shouldn't go into that here, but I do think I could've better said why she's my favorite E4 member. So, here it goes:

---
*""What are you doing in a place like this?""*

1. Most new trainers train on the move or at gyms/schools. This young girl decided to train with a Dusclops, solely on the mountain graveyard for Pokemon known as Mt. Pyre. 

2. She learned to see other ghost Pokemon based on that training. And her career began. Ghost Pokemon can't normally be seen unless they choose to reveal themselves. She's the only trainer I know so far with this awareness (besides supposedly Allister).

3. She's one of the few trainers who can talk to their Pokemon at all. But she can talk to ghost Pokemon in general.

4. Her behavior. When you first meet her, she's chatting with some unseen ghost girl--she immediately laughs and introduces herself to you. Smiling the whole time, and bouncing and swinging her arms as if she's half-possessed. It makes her eagerness to fight you almost eerie.

5. The ghost girl's connection with Phoebe. The girl in Phoebe's chair isn't her grandmother because her grandmother is always there until the postgame begins (if you lose to Steven, she's still there). We never know who it is for sure. But what matters is Phoebe's talking with this girl, then happily ready for battle. While the girl leerily approaches the player who's just interrupted them. There's so much more to read with this pre-battle compared to the others. Before you even enter, you've got a bunch of spirits lighting her lair and letting you in. Whereas XY made me feel like The Guy, walking into this deviancy just made me glad I was in an official league.

6. Phoebe in the postgame also mentions her grandmother. Now, Phoebe never mentions being able to speak with dead people. And the graves she's speaking near were there since the beginning of the story: Mt. Pyre is for Pokemon. But I still believe her grandmother passed. For one, she mentions her grandmother's thoughts about the player but not her grandfather's, even though the player saved the world for both of them. Two, she says in the JP that the player ""even now"" has made an impression on her grandmother. As in, is continuing to do so. She can't know this without being able to communicate with deceased people as well. And the ""even now"" is more significant when she's referring to someone who's dead, as opposed to her grandfather, where the ""lasting impression even now"" wouldn't be surprising at all (as he's alive and it's only been a few days since Steven). Aside from that, she mentions her grandmother joking here and elsewhere. The grave isn't her grandmother's, but the summit in general is where her grandmother lives.

---

But the whole point for #6 is that her grandmother's passed, and she doesn't give a damn. I'm not saying she's ""cold"" for not bawling her eyes out. But she legitimately doesn't feel any difference. She visits her dead grandmother no differently in life or death. There's no formal ""respects"". When the player mentions paying respects to the deceased, Phoebe casually says her ghost-loving grandmother sees that air in them. You'd *almost* think Phoebe's in denial about losing her grandmother.

On that note, I don't know anything about Masters. I do know it had her and her Dusclops hunting fleeing spirits for the Dusclops to eat...and counting them in a contest before it ate them.

Now, Agatha is one of my favorite E4. So I'll respectfully say, she's not as eerie. I've long thought she was the ""Vegeta"" to Oak's ""Goku,"" who got upset that Oak retired before she could beat him. She's a grumpy old woman who loves to battle and holds a grudge. There's some tension there. But when some people say *only* Agatha has the creepy ghost trainer vibe, I don't get it.

Phoebe isn't jealous of anyone. In fact, she doesn't get personally caught up with other people like the other ghost trainers. Agatha gets angry, Morty gets let down, Fantina's trying to show off...Allister's afraid of others....

...Phoebe usually has an unsettling grin on her face. Even when she loses. She trains alone and only talks to ghosts, challengers, and occasional visitors to Mt. Pyre. She doesn't have a clear goal like Morty (researcher/Ho-Oh), Fantina (performer), Shauntal (novelist), any of them. She exists to wander among death and spirits while being unnaturally happy.

Her lack of direction besides hanging in cemeteries, and her random, senseless clothing gives me the vibe of a free-spirit who's even more comfortable around graves and the deceased than with the living. I can't judge every trainer or speak for everyone, but I think she does a great job as a ""happy-go-lucky...but don't get too comfortable"" type of woman.",2022-12-19 00:35:19

Pokemon Towns are more than just boring copy-paste houses with NPCs,98,zpa541,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zpa541/pokemon_towns_are_more_than_just_boring_copypaste/,46,1671402124.0,"One thing that I have seen being brought up multiple times recently is the town design in Scarlet and Violet. Often when this aspect of the game is discussed, people talk about the NPCs you talk to, and some fans argue that Scarlet and Violet has just as many NPCs to interact with as previous games, with the only difference of them being outside now instead of indoors. 

Every time I read these arguments, I wonder: don't you miss the things you could do and the unique places you could visit in towns in previous games? 

Let's look at Nimbasa City from B2W2 for a moment, to see what I mean: that town has 10 buildings you can enter, plus a Ferris wheel and Join Avenue right attached to the entrance of the town. Two of those buildings are just the Pokemon Center and the gym. But beyond that, you have the Battle Subway where you can spend hours upon hours building up win streaks, the Battle Institute where you can let your battle get rated, the two sports stadiums that provide you with a daily amount of trainer battles, the Musical Hall where you can have this game's version of the contests, the old gym that you can visit and three residential buildings where you can get two or three useful items. The Ferris wheel is its own little thing and even comes with a little mini quest/story and some pretty cool NPC trades. And finally, Join Avenue lets you build up your own mall for as long as you want. 

But I'll admit, Nimbasa is a rather extreme example. Though towns also don't even need THAT much to be more memorable and filled with life. Even small, almost meaningless buildings like trainer schools, museums, corporate buildings, game corners and so on all made a town stand out and feel more alive. They don't provide much content usually, but they come with their own aesthetic, their own little lore or flavor texts. 

And you can't really replace those buildings by just putting the NPCs out on the street. 

In Scarlet and Violet's towns, you can't really DO much at all. Nothing unique at least. 

This is a trend that was already evident in Sword and Shield, where most buildings and towns didn't offer much unique content at all. But now they've even taken the generic residential buildings and houses from us.

I guess I'm just struggling to understand why so many people seem to not care about any of these things. Yes, the towns in SV are aesthetically well designed, but where's the Bellsprout Tower, the Pokemon World Tournament halls, the ancient ruin, the port with ships to interact, the contest halls, Pokemon Fan Club, GameFreak HQ and so on? Where are these unique places within towns or attached to towns that we used to have access to? 

And don't say something like ""they are out in the wild now"", cause old games ALSO had stuff to find on routes and outside of towns in addition to what you could find within the towns (and, being honest, it's not like there's much to find in Paldea's nature and wilderness either \^\^).",2022-12-19 00:22:04

Playing through, growing attached to your Pokemon, only to find out that your Pokémon's nature or IV/EV spread was hindering it in a serious way. It's the same thing every game: I go in blind because I don't want spoilers, only to be bombarded with stuff I was supposed to be prepared for.

Luckily they've solved a lot of these problems in the last generations. You can now change your nature, your IVs, your abilities, easily change EVs, and now you can even teach Egg moves. For all its flaws, S/V (and Legends Arceus) have been the only games I feel I can just play freely.

However, I still feel like there's always another little trap, and I'd like to list them here. I'll start with two, and hopefully you'll be able to help me come up with more.

1. Sporeless Breloom. If you evolve Shroomish into Breloom, it won't be able to ever learn Spore.
2. If you don't catch the right Rockruff (one with Own Tempo), you'll never be able to evolve it into its Dusk Form. You won't be able to change its nature either. Same applies if you catch a Rockruff with Own Tempo and want to evolve it into its Midday or Night form.

Goal is to limit the catching pool to a small number of options, but have enough to make a whole distinct team. In any case of a tricky team not startable in Area 1 South, I'd trade in a level 5 to serve as Starter.

Some of the ones I'd considered were:

**-Insectoid-** The inspiration for this was aDrive on youtube who runs a buglocke each game. Could even do a Moth subteam honestly. 

**-Canine-** From Fidough to Lycanroc and maybe the Eevees.

**-Avian-** Plenty of birds to choose from across the game, though with a similar weakness in many.

\-**Legion-** Humanoid pokemon, or those with a military theme or weapon wielders.

idea : pokemon legend necrozma.

plot : this game take place in an alternate reality where the hero of ultra sun/moon has been defeated by necrozma, but has been sent to the future and became amnesic. (you play as him) you are welcomed by lillie, who has becamed a proffessor. she doesn't recognise you. you then meet with the population of po town, wich is a refuge for the remaining population, where you can find a lot of familiar characters. lillie then offers you a choice between three pokemons : chikorita, scorbunny and piplup.

scenario : you will have two main objectives. one : complete the pokedex, with the same mechanics as in legend arceus. two : beat ultra-beasts that now rule the islands. as you progress through the story, you will find more hints about what really happened and yourself.

pokemons : a grass/rock meganium, a fire/ground cinderace and a water/ice empoleon for starters. and also new forms for the tapus. i also imagine some new ultra-beasts running around.

riding pokemons : mudsdale to go fast, a bigger lycanrock dust to find objects, a regional evolution of mantine to go on the water, a bigger drampa to climb and a new form of oricorio to fly.

the game would end with a fight with ultra-necrozma on aether paradise.

However in Paldea flower Vivillon is obtainable in the wild (you find it near the fairy team star base). In fact flower Vivillon is the only form you can get in Paldea without transfering from another game. Maybe the reason why you can’t get flower Vivillon in Kalos is because it’s native to Paldea.

Game ideas.,1,zp6j1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zp6j1g/game_ideas/,5,1671392685.0,"So while sitting in the shower, a thought came to me. SV seem to be a reboot to the series in the way the Force Awakens was to Star Wars. Like it's still Pokemon, but it's meant to entice a new generation of players, especially with the show coming around and Ash retiring. This said, how would you design a new game, mainly a mainline one, to fit into the world? Here's mine:

The region is based on Greece, with an ancient Grecko theme. Player Character (PC) is a native to the region, who's mom is the champion, but you're unaware. The background is the the PCs father was driven mad by a wild pokemon, and became the evil team boss, with a goal of destruction or something, think the scale of Cyrus, but maybe a different goal. Mom becomes champion in an attempt to stop him, and by you facing her, you prove that it's your duty to do it.

 We'll throw a few twists tho. First, dad is gonna be a high level boss, like 70s for his team, to make it rough. The starter trio also would be different, like a typing. Instead of Grass, Water, Fire, maybe give us 3 dragons, or another trio type that works. As for box art, since we're doing the Greek theme, let's do Cronos and Gaia as the box legendaries, and make the 12 Olympians the roaming Legends you catch around the map, but doing certain challenges and stuff. 

I don't have everything hashed out, but it's a thought. I'd love to hear other people's ideas, and criticisms of my own.",2022-12-18 21:44:45

I get it's a fairly new type but still, I feel like the type is lacking. So here are some ideas of moves I'd create:

**Crush Hug**

Power: 65

Accuracy: 90

Category: Physical

PP: 20

Description: The user affectionately hugs or squeezes the target with its body, as if it were to be crushed. For 3 turns, the target cannot flee from battle, has their attack lowered and loses 1/8 HP.


**Star Shower**

Power: 145

Accuracy: 80

Category: Special

PP: 5

Description: Stars are summoned to rain down on opposing Pokemon. The user cannot use a Special Attack the following turn.

**Pep Up Slap**

*Wake up Slap returns to the games and changes from a Fighting type move to a Fairy type move. It's new name is now ""Pep up Slap*

Power: 70 

Accuracy: 100

Category: Physical

PP: 10

Description: With healing energy, the user slaps the target. This deals double damage if it has any status condition (including confusion) but heals the status condition.

**Rainbow Shield**

Category: Status

PP: 10

Description: The user cloaks itself with a rainbow light. This light, for the next 3 turns, changes the user's type to resist incoming attacks. 

**Rainbow Change**

Category: Status

PP: 10

Description: The user shrouds itself in rainbow light. This light for the next three turns, changes the user's type to match the type of move its using.

**Return**

*Return makes a comeback and is now a Fairy type move. All other mechanics for this move remain the same.*

Making older regions open world would likely require quite a lot of extra work, because since the old maps were designed to be linear; if they just used the same ones again it wouldn’t make sense. They’d have to make bigger, wider maps, that made the regions look more open and big.

I think that making the games open world would also leave tons of room to make the towns and cities feel alive rather than just have a few houses and a Pokémon center and calling it quits.

I dunno though, what do you guys think?",2022-12-18 20:14:39

Rotom was caught at level 20 at the old chateau and died at level 20, Rotom was the last pokemon I ever caught, Rotom was defeated second. Combee was caught at level 11 at Floaroma meadow using honey on a honey tree to attract it and died at level 15, Combee was caught to add an extra flyer to go up against Gardenias grass type pokemon, though a male, only the female combees evolved, I still caught him, Combee was defeated third. Pachirisu was caught at level 11 at route 205 and died at level 17, I named her nuts as a dirty joke, Pachirisu soon became my next electric pokemon after Shinx and avenged both Monferno and Machop by taking out the Psyduck that defeated them, Pachirisu soon became one of my stronger pokemon after Monfernos and Machops death but things were unfortunate and it died fourth against Skuntank.

What changes would you make to Pokémon stats?,1,zp2tcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zp2tcd/what_changes_would_you_make_to_pokémon_stats/,11,1671382214.0,"There are some pokemon that I think should have their stats rearranged to make them fit better either with their designs or move-sets. My two biggest examples are Pyroar and Unfeazant. 

Pyroar: The make/female split evolutions should come with different stats and move-sets. Female being a fast physical attacker with more biting and slashing moves. Male being a slightly slower, but bulkier, special attacker with moves like Hyper Voice, Flamethrower, and Solarbeam.

Unfeazant: It can keep its existing moveset, but it should definitely have been a special attacker. Not only would it be more useful without TMs, but it also would have been fairly unique among early game birds in being a special attacker (the only other one being Noctowl).

I understand that the Destiny Knot item is ment to take 5ivs from the 12 possible given by the parents. My current situation is that the majority of the off spring get 4ivs, with some getting the odd 5ivs, and I don't understand.

With both parents having a combined pool of 10/12ivs to pick from, how is this happening? Does the Destiny Knot not activate 100% of the time?

Also, with the passing down of ivs, is it not guaranteed to give perfect attack for example if both parents have perfect attack ivs?

* Three Segment Dudunsparce/Family of Three Maushold have a chance of 1/100 to spawn
* Shiny odds are 1/4,096, or 1/512 at best odds (Cannot be Masuda'd for the Mark)
* A 6IV Pokemon is 1/(32\^6), or 1/1,073,741,824
* The Rare Mark is a 1/1000 chance

Putting all of these together makes it a chance of

* 1/5.4975581e+16 (0.000000000000000055%) at best odds
* 1/ 4.3980465e+17 (**0.0000000000000000044%**) at full odds

To put this in comparison, spawning 20 Pokemon every minute (with 0 breaks) would take

* approximately 5 million years with best odds
* approximately **41 million years** with full odds

A preferred nature (1/25 chance) is

You could stack them, but you had to put each one diagonally from the one below, so that the corners didn't touch, but rested between the corners of the one below.

The best thing Pokemon can do to refresh the game competitively is not another gimmick; it's reworking/buffing the 400+ competitively unviable pokemon.,166,zoq0y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zoq0y5/the_best_thing_pokemon_can_do_to_refresh_the_game/,38,1671338104.0,"Pokemon isnone of the oldest and most well respected franchises; however, outside of a select few fan favorites and basically just gen 1, there are literally hundreds of pokemon that have virtually always been completely useless.  Many, many pokemon that have 0 usage, 0 niche, 0 competitive appeal could be sprung back to life with better movepools, better abilities or stat changes. 

  Pokemon historically loves to kneel into nostalgia, whether it's by constantly giving special attention to premier moms like charizard, pikachu and eevee... But imagine if the entire roster got newfound attention and love? 

  The most unfortunate part about pokemon is out of the 500 or so fully evolved pokemon, there are less than 50 at one time that are competitively viable.

The best way to get shiny Pokémon in SV is by not playing SV,0,zobuuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zobuuv/the_best_way_to_get_shiny_pokémon_in_sv_is_by_not/,3,1671299643.0,"Given the fact that most raids in SV don't award the herbs required to efficiently farm for shiny Pokémon, and they have made it a nightmare to farm them by removing the sparkling and noise from seeing them in the overworld, It is incredibly inefficient to farm for shiny Pokémon right now. Literally the best way to obtain them is by not even playing SV at all, but instead, going back to older games. In Pokémon Arceus, for example, You can dramatically increase your chance of finding a shiny simply by completing pokédex entries for Pokémon.


**Take Eevee as an example.**  

Extremely rare Pokémon in SV for no reason whatsoever. You will likely never see more than one or two of them at a time, and your chance of finding one that is shiny is extremely slim because Even with the sandwich that increases the chance of a shiny, it will be surrounded by other normal Pokémon that appear as well at the same time. Finding an outbreak for this specific Pokémon is near impossible, I have played for a couple weeks so far and haven't seen one yet. 


Here's what makes Arceus so much better:


- Outbreaks are much more frequent, and selection is much better. There are virtually no outbreaks in Arceus for trash Pokémon. All of them are decent Pokémon you would actually want to capture


- Significantly better performance all around. SV has TERRIBLE performance and frame drops, especially around water. Lake for example where Gyarados spawns is insanely bad. It has 5 FPS at times 


- Visual and audio cue for seeing a shiny in the overworld. **SV HAS NOTHING FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED PLAYERS** 


- No need to engage in a battle to catch it at all. Just throw pokeballs repeatedly and you've got a nice shiny


- Mass releasing of non shiny Pokemon at once. You literally can't release more than one Pokémon in SV


- Much more efficient way to increase chance of shiny Pokémon you want. SV requires grinding raids that are currently frustrating, bug infested, and rarely award herbs without manipulating a glitch to reset and redo the raid again and again and again",2022-12-17 19:54:03

No offence is meant, I'm just pointing out how Pokemon could have drawn from real-world mythology as a basis for story elements.

Hi, everyone. I wanted to get some of my thoughts out about a lot of the unanswered questions presented to us in Scarlet/Violet. Some of these theories are synthesized from rumblings I've heard among the Pokemon community, and some are things that have been bouncing around in my noggin since playing Violet. I rarely post on reddit, so I apologize if the formatting is a bit goofy. MASSIVE wall of text incoming...

# A Theory about Paldea

The Paldea region seems to bring up more questions than it answers, when it comes to lore.  One of the biggest mysteries we’re presented with is that of the Terastal phenomenon.  Since Gen. VI, we’ve had a new gimmick in each generation that changes the style, pace, and meta of battles.  Gen VI had Mega-Evolution, Gen VII had Z Moves, Gen VIII had Dyna- and Gigantamaxing, and now Gen IX has Terastallizing.  

However, each generation in which these gimmicks are introduced also provides a reason, some sort of lore that details how each phenomenon came about:

• In X/Y, we learn that Mega-Evolution is a byproduct of the energy released when AZ used the ultimate weapon in order to end an ancient war.  

• In US/UM, the Ultra Recon Squad very heavily Z-Rings used to initiate Z-Moves may be shards that fell off Necrozma’s body after the ancient Megalopolitans tried to harness it’s light. They state that Ultra Megolopolis used to have a light similar to that which emanates from the Z-Rings, and that light was able to induce Z-Move-like abilities in their Ultra Beasts.  

• In Sword/Shield, energy leaking from the dormant Eternatus seeped throughout the Galar region, creating Dynamax Spots.  Pieces of Eternatus’ body fell off and were scattered around Galar, which were later crafted into Dynamax Bands.  

And yet, we have hardly any information about the origins of the Terastal phenomenon.  We do know that it is closely tied to the Great Crater of Paldea, as we see giant crystals growing deep in the crater which Prof. Sada/Turo identify as Tera crystals.  Penny astutely deduces that the Tera Orbs Paldean trainers carry around must be produced from the crystals found in Area Zero. Moreover, we know that they must have an extraordinarily fast rate of growth, as the lab at the depths of Area Zero is completely encased in them.  The lab and research stations were built approximately ~~10 years ago when Sada/Turo began researching Area Zero~~ 87 years ago by Heath.  It may be possible that the lab was built into a pre-existing crystal, but based on the reactions from Penny, Arven, and Nemona, it seems the crystals grew around it.  But how did the crystals get there?  What sort of phenomenon caused them to grow?

Here’s where we get in to the theory part.  We know that Paldea is inspired by the real-world country of Spain, and Kalos was inspired by France.  Given the two countries’ real-world proximity, I think Kalos and Paldea must be geographic neighbors, as well.  There’s even a portion of the map in S/V that’s inaccessible in the northeast corner.  This area is blocked off by tall mountains, mirroring the Pyrenees Mountain range that divides Spain and France.  It’s extremely likely that Kalos lies not too far beyond those mountains.  

But what does that have to do with the Great Crater?  I think the crater was caused by the impact of an extremely powerful force, namely the ultimate weapon used by AZ.  We know from the history given to us in X/Y that AZ used the ultimate weapon 3000 years ago to end a war between Kalos and another country, but the other country is never named.  The massive amount of life energy released from the ultimate weapon caused the Mega-Evolution phenomenon in Kalos and other regions, but the impact from a weapon of such strength could have introduced a completely different kind of energy into Paldea.

Vitrification is the process by which materials are heated and rapidly cooled, producing a glassy substance.  The massive blast from AZ’s weapon could most certainly melt rock into magma; subsequently, the numerous waterfalls that feed into the Crater could have cooled the magma and vitrified it.  But that would mean the materials found in Area Zero are glass, not crystals.  Most of these crystals in the Crater are pearlescent and reflective, which more closely aligns with glass over crystal.  

But that doesn’t explain how the crystals keep growing.  We know that AZ’s weapon was powered by the souls of pokemon and, presumably, people. That life energy was able to bring AZ’s Floette back to life, so we know the energy harnessed by the weapon was able to impart life into dead creatures.  That is to say, the potable energy of spirits was launched in a massive blast towards Paldea.

Now, we know from real-world scientific experimentation that photons and certain types of energy can be forcibly trapped within specialized crystalline structures.  Did residual spirit energy from the blast somehow get trapped within the crystalline structures deep within Area Zero?  Could it be that the Terastal phenomenon is actually harnessing the energy of long-since deceased pokemon in order to enhance the capabilities of living pokemon?  

Also, Area Zero seems to line up with AZ’s name.  It may be coincidence, but it may also be foreshadowing to events we haven’t seen yet in game.

What’s more, there is strong evidence that the Tera crystals may be able to develop minds of their own, or at the least, form symbiotic relationships with living pokemon.  We see this with the pokemon Glimmora.  It is found all over the place in the massive cave beneath Area Zero, both floating around and attached to the walls.  Glimmora’s Violet pokedex entry states that “It has recently become evident that [Glimmora’s] petals resemble Tera jewels.”  Either Glimmora’s petals are composed of Tera crystal energy, or it has adapted to the environment of Area Zero in order to absorb energy the same way the crystals do.  


# Chairwoman Geeta

But Glimmora links us to another piece of the puzzle: Chairwoman Geeta.  The Pokemon community seems divided about Geeta, given how easy her champion fight is.  But the ease of the fight isn’t what’s important here.  Is it just me, or does something seem… off about Geeta?  Her eyes are much, much larger in proportion to her face compared to other characters, and she always stands nearly motionless.  Geeta always seems to take a neutral and highly formal register of speech when we see her interact with the player and other characters.  Seeing as she’s the Chairwoman of the Paldean Pokemon League, this may be expected, but even other members of the Elite Four and Gym Leaders don’t conduct themselves this way.  Even Clavell, who presents himself as proper and collected, lets loose and gets himself into some goofy situations through the course of the story.  Every time we see Geeta, she’s always neutral and seemingly emotionless.

Moreover, it seems there are multiple ranking trainers throughout Paldea that don’t hold a favorable view of the Chairwoman.  Katy, Tulip, Ryme, and Grusha all express some sort of negative sentiment towards Geeta, mostly about her micromanaging their gyms to the point where it suppresses their true battle prowess.  Larry, in a similar sense, expresses exasperation at Geeta’s management style in that she personally intervenes and strong-arms him to use a Flying-type team in his Elite Four battle against the player when he states that he prefers to use Normal types.  That’s 5 out of 8 (or 11 if you count E4) League-affiliated trainers who have voiced disagreements with the Chairwoman.

This may be a bit out there, but I don’t think Geeta is human.  I think she’s and A.I.  We see similar flat, emotionless behavior when we finally meet Sada/Turo.  But even there, we see glimpses of Sada’s/Turo’s personality when they get the chance to talk to Arven.  

The second similarity between them is that both Geeta and Sada/Turo make it a point to express that they are incapable of holding back in battle.  Sada/Turo state that the A.I. program learned to battle by watching the Champions of Paldea battle.  Who does every Champion have to battle in order to be crowned Champion?  None other than Geeta.  

I think Geeta is an extention of the Sada/Turo A.I. designed to gather battle data in order to strengthen the battle algorithms of the Paradise Protection Program.  In this capacity, Geeta found herself Chairwoman of the Paldea Pokemon League; in doing so, she conducts regular battle evaluations amongst the Gym Leaders, and acts as the final arbiter as to who gets to become a Champion.  She personally makes sure that the gyms around the region are providing sufficient challenge such that gifted trainers are compelled to grow stronger and stronger in order to complete all of them and grow capable of challenging the Elite Four. The gyms have to strike the right balance of engaging trainers who are good at/enjoy battling, while still weeding out less capable trainers.  It’s even pointed out to us a few times that most trainers drop their gym circuit challenge after certain points, a first time in the series where gym challenge attrition is mentioned.

Additionally, Paldea is the first region where we’re explicitly told that there are multiple sitting Champions.  I believe that this unspoken rule is altered from the other games, not just for narrative purposes, but for another, more practical purpose.  By allowing the crowning of multiple champions, Geeta can fulfill her duty in recognizing powerful trainers to the league and the region, but still stand as the person who battles EVERY Champion-level trainer.  Whether knowingly or unknowingly, Geeta is making sure Paldea creates as many Champions as possible so she can feed battle data back to the A.I. in Area Zero.

But I think La Primera has a deeper connection to Area Zero.  Geeta’s ace is Glimmora, a pokemon who’s ability and move pool make it more suited to an opener or support pokemon, yet she sends it out last.  Why would she send such an anti-climactic pokemon out last in what should be the most climactic battle for most trainers?

While exploring Area Zero, when the party encounters a wild Glimmora outside Research Station 1, Nemona remarks that it’s the same pokemon Geeta uses on her team.  After defeating it, the party wonders if Geeta might have come to Area Zero at some time in the past.  If she’s an extension of the A.I., that’s a given, but there’s more information that may strengthen the idea.  

The journals scattered about the Research Stations are seemingly written by Sada/Turo as head of the expedition team that ventured into the Crater 10 years ago.  These journals suggest that the expedition started with a decent-sized team, but was slowly whittled down due to the dangerous environment, aggressive pokemon, or leaving due to professional disagreements.  In one journal, Sada/Turo express how, due to attrition, they wish they had more people to help them in their research.  A nearby journal jumps to the professor remarking how their new assistant is almost as knowledgeable as them.  Most players assume, given the end of the Area Zero story, that the new assistant is the A.I. Sada/Turo, but I don’t think this is the case.

A.I. programs as we know them are iterative and learn from repeated input.  A.I. Sada/Turo remark that human technology is incapable of creating a computer sophisticated enough to sustain an Artificial Intelligence, but the energy in the Tera crystals enhance the possibilities of technology.  But I still don’t think the research team would be able to create a full-fledged A.I. on the first try.  They had to have had predecessors and prototypes.  I think the assistant Sada/Turo detailed in their journal was Geeta.  She was created, possibly without a human personality to be modeled afterwards, which resulted in her flat mannerisms.  I think another A.I. assistant was in the works when the incident at Research Station 4 happened, and after the professor passed away, A.I. Geeta and the rest of the researchers departed Area Zero.

However, A.I. Sada/Turo states that because their subroutines are based on Tera technology, they weren’t able to leave Area Zero.  I think this is a lie.  The A.I. professor shows a moment of genuine emotion and introspection when talking to Arven, telling him how much the professor loved their son.  However, being modeled on the professor’s emotions, they still carried their desires.  I think that, just as in life the professor chose research over their son, so did the A.I.  But the A.I. eventually saw the flaws in Sada’s/Turo’s logic, and dedicated itself to mitigating the impending disaster.  A.I. Sada/Turo didn’t leave the lab because of a technical restriction, but because they were inexorably linked by the real professor to the Paradise Protection Program, and as such were the only person capable of managing the Time Machine after the real professor’s death.  

We know the A.I. could have left Area Zero because of technology we see littered across Paldea.  The energy in the Tera orbs trainers carry are depleted of energy after being used, yet can easily be recharged at any Pokemon Center.  So even if the energy housed in the Tera crystals is ostensibly a mystery, the Pokemon League, due in large part to the professor, knows how to harness the energy and distribute it across the region for trainers to use at leisure.  

The rudimentary A.I. powering Geeta could potentially be run using this energy distribution system.  Failing this, her Glimmora could be a backup battery to power the A.I.  But for this to be feasible, we have to take one of the two following possibilities: either

a) The crystals that make up Glimmora’s bodies are made up of Tera crystal particles, and are thus functionally similar to Tera crystals in storing and generating Tera energy, or

b) Glimmora are adapted to surviving in Area Zero by absorbing, storing, and metabolizing Tera energy, thus acting as biological Tera crystals.

If Geeta is an A.I. powered by the Tera phenomenon, and if we take either or both of the above as possible, it would explain the order of Geeta’s Champion test team.  Her Glimmora was caught by the expedition in Area Zero with the intent of being studied, but when the lab was abandoned, she brought Glimmora with her.  Her Glimmora is her treasure, her oldest friend, and her lifeline.  


# Not Geeta, but Gita

While trying to dig up more information on La Primera, Google kept redirecting me to the Gita, also known as the Bhagavad Gita, a foundational text in Hinduism.  The more I read about the Gita, the more parallels I saw between it and the story of S/V.  The Gita takes place in the shadow of a war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  The Pandavas were a group of five legendary brothers who are central characters of the Mahabharata. The Kauravas were a force comprised of the descendants of the great king Kuru.  The central figure of the Bhagavad Gita is the Pandava prince Arjuna, who is guided and counseled by Krishna.  Through the course of the Gita, Krishna teaches Arjuna about various core principles of Hinduism, such as karma, bhakti, jnana, dharma, and moksha.

We learn from Raifort in history class that Paldea’s ancient past was one of multiple smaller domains that came together to form the greater region.  I see Paldea’s smaller domains as an allegory to the Pandavas, a faction with several brothers as their figureheads.  Similarly, Kalos used to be a monarchy, ruled by a single leader, much like the Kauravas.  The Pandavas and Kauravas were locked in war, framing the events of the Bhagavad Gita, and my Great Crater theory contends that Paldea and Kalos were similarly embroiled in war in the ancient past. Coincidentally, Paldea and Pandavas start with the same letter, as do Kalos and Kauravas.

The topics of karma, bhakti, jnana, dharma, and moksha are pivotal principles in Hinduism, but we can see parallels to these principles in the story presented to us in Scarlet and Violet.

## Karma

The Gita describes karma as the path of selfless action, or action done without attachment to personal reward or gain.  

Cassiopeia seeks to dismantle Team Star both from within and without, and to this end she has operatives inside the team and contracts the player and Clive to help disrupt from the outside.  At the climax of Operation Starfall, it is revealed that Penny was Cassiopeia all along.  She sought to dismantle Team Star, not for her own personal gain, but because the leaders of the various Star Squads were her close friends.  She recognized that the continued existence of the team would be detrimental and pointless to her friends in the long run, so covertly sought to set them back on the right path.  She took action to save her friends, knowing that not only would she not prosper from it, but would likely suffer severe consequences from her own actions.  

Penny embodies karma because she took action knowing it was the right thing to do, and without attachment to her own personal outcome.

## Bhakti

Bhakti can be loosely described as devotion to a deity or one’s own sense of right and wrong.  Some interpretations say that bhakti, or devotion to something other than the self, is not a renunciation of action, but a mobilization of action after gaining the proper knowledge.  

Arven initially framed his search for the Herba Mystica as a purely selfish pursuit, claiming he wanted to find superb ingredients mentioned in an old book in order to make the finest dishes he could.  After helping him find a few of the Herba, the player finds out that his pursuit was, in fact, entirely selfless.  Arven sought the Herba as a way to save his partner Mabostiff, who was grievously injured and in a near-death state.  The climax of Arven’s story, after finding all five Herba Mystica, results in the magical healing powers of the herbs restoring the health of his Mabosstiff.  

Arven embodies bhakti because he showed devotion to someone outside of himself, and took action after acquiring the proper knowledge.

## Jnana

Jnana is characterized as the path of wisdom and realization of the self.  The Gita claims that this path is steep and difficult, but dear to Krishna.  

Nemona is an avid fan of pokemon battling, sometimes obnoxiously so.  But she has already attained the title of Champion before the start of the game, and while still a student at the Academy.  She helps the player navigate their Gym Circuit Challenge all the way up through the Champion Assessment, periodically testing the player through battle in order to test their resolve and maintain her own.  She has already reached the pinnacle of her own ideals, and is genuinely elated when others follow in her footsteps.

Nemona embodies Jnana in having realized her own personal ideals, and helping the player along the same path.

## Dharma

Dharma has a more open-ended interpretation than some of the concepts discussed above, but can be essentially boiled down to that which is right and just within duty, law, social class, societal norms, and the cosmos itself.  Some scholars view the Gita’s interpretation of dharma through the lens of the events of the Mahabharata.  Arjuna, as a warrior, is called into war, and Hindu scholars assert that as a warrior, it is his dharma to fight to protect the innocent.  

I feel that dharma is best embodied by the player character.  Being a student at the Academy, and having become friends and compatriots with the other story-centric characters, it is the player’s dharma to not only discover their own treasure through the treasure hunt, but also to help out their friends in their time of need.  Being drawn into these different stories, it is dharma to see them through; being brought into the events of Area Zero, it is dharma to make things right and protect the innocent inhabitants of Paldea from the environmental collapse threatened by the Paradox pokemon.  

## Moksha

Moksha is liberation.  In the Gita, Krishna suggests a combination of karma, bhakti, and jnana (or selfless action, devotion, and knowledge) as a way to achieve moksha.  Some philosophies claim that all must be achieved by one’s own effort in order to reach moksha.

While not strictly human, I believe that A.I. Sada/Turo best embody moksha.  The A.I. expresses admiration of the player and their friends at the end of the final storyline, praising Penny for acting outside of herself for the sake of others, praising Nemona for working her hardest to realize her own goals, praising Arven for devotion to those other than himself, and praising the character finding their own treasure, their own dharma.  The actions of these four give the A.I. the spark of inspiration that it can overcome its own limitations.  It acts selflessly in sending itself through the Time Machine in order to shut it down, realizing that it is the only one who can truly interrupt its functions, and that doing so is necessary to protect the innocent inhabitants of Paldea.  In synthesizing these ideals, the A.I. finally achieves liberation.  

## Geeta’s Name

Once again, Geeta is the linchpin in this theory.  Based on her name and her appearance, I always though she was supposed to be coded as Indian.  Her name in the English localization is considered to come from the scientific name Sagittaria, a genus of Arrowhead plants.  More concisely, her Japanese name, Omodaka, is the Japanese word for Threeleaf Arrowhead (sagittaria trifolio).  Human characters in pokemon media being named after plants isn’t new, but Geeta’s Japanese name points to something interesting: though most characters in Scarlet/Violet are named after plants, Geeta’s namesake (sagittaria trifolio) is the only plant that is naturally endemic to India.  This, paired with the fact that Geeta’s English name sounds exactly the same as Gita, leads me to believe that her design and name pointing to the fact that she’s Indian is more than just a coincidence.  Her name and implied ethnicity have little bearing on the veracity of the Great Crater theory, but do further emphasize the similarities between the story of S/V and the Bhagavad Gita.

I think, given the similarities between the story of Scarlet/Violet and the Bhagavad Gita, the implied connection between Kalos and Paldea, that future DLC for the games can go one of two routes:

1. Exploring the past of Paldea and Kalos, and the ramifications the war and AZ's actions had on both sides, and/or

2. Exploring the more philosophical elements of the Pokemon universe, what it means to find your own purpose/treasure, and the dynamics between the characters (Prof. and Arven, maybe? Or more about the expedition team 10 years ago).

"Team Rocket should still make regular appearances in the anime, even without Ash and Pikachu.",18,zp0irw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zp0irw/team_rocket_should_still_make_regular_appearances/,9,1671375677.0,"When I heard the news about Ash and Pikachu being retired as the faces of the anime, it felt bittersweet. But Ash and Pikachu weren’t the reason why. On the contrary, Ash’s removal has been inevitable since long before the tournament started, at least in my eyes. Helix knows they’ve been beating that dead Horsea for too long.

Nope, Team Rocket is why. Their presence in the anime is basically a requirement, as an integral part of its legacy. Changing protagonists is nothing new, and having Ash step out of the spotlight is fitting at this point. But I find myself struggling to justify Team Rocket getting the boot as well. Let me break it down for you:

———

If Team Rocket really ends up “blasting off” for good, then the series would lose its anchor; its universal connection point that viewers of any kind could immediately recognize, which all widely-established franchises need, regardless of how its content has shifted over time. Like Star Wars, the fans need something familiar that they can latch onto for stability within a different environment, no matter how severe the changes may seem at first glance. Seriously, it is VERY important.

And I think we all know that anchor isn’t Ash, due to the countless opportunities they’ve had over the years to safely replace him without risking backlash. Because honestly, now that he’s actually pulled it off, Ash is just there to be a shoulder for Pikachu, who is just there to be a motive for Team Rocket. Good ol’ Team Rocket, whose ever-present antics keep us grounded no matter what the current state of the franchise is. Our favorite questionably-evil yet undeniably-lovable trio, whose names are imprinted within our ears and emblazoned upon our hearts:

“Jessie… James… and Meowth! (That’s right)!”

Did you see how I added Meowth’s catchphrase in parentheses? It’s there to prove a point: if you just say their names out loud, it wouldn’t sound right without their famous conclusory tagline. When referring to the iconic intros and stylish mottos of Team Rocket, to not include our favorite feline’s classic quip just feels wrong. So by having it clearly highlighted as a point of familiarity within the text, you can instantly recognize who is saying what you are reading. Rather than some indescribable mental voice conveying dialogue in your head, the actual cast is making their presence known; not through a screen, but in your heart.

THAT is what an established franchise needs. A likable hero is good and all, but a memorable villain is what ties everything together. And while Team Rocket may not be skilled at the villain part, their image is so iconic that they can tie it all together on their own. I can’t think of a better foil to a main cast across all of media, and that’s because Team Rocket IS the main cast.

From a story-telling perspective, building them into the core narrative is the biggest guarantee that things could go wrong, and things need to go wrong if a plotline wants to keep its audience invested; conflict is the basis for story-telling, after all. And with Team Rocket’s entire image revolving around crime, their inevitable role as the perpetrator of every episode’s conflict is what has kept us anchored to the series for over two-and-a-half decades. They’ve become so engrained with how we expect problems to arise that now removing them would cause real life problems. Big ones!

A world without Team Rocket is chaos, because they’re supposed to handle all of the chaos on their own, leaving some nice, orderly structure for the heroes—and us—after they’ve been launched into the stratosphere. Without that guarantee, issues of all kinds could manifest in the plot, which in this case is a BAD thing. That’s what the movies are for. Outside of a theatrical release, we have come to innately desire that security we feel from knowing the means of conflict before an episode even starts. Even if we think we want something else, we are subconsciously wired at this point to feel threatened by anything not within Team Rocket’s established scope. Which admittedly feels pretty weird to say in my case, as someone who has wanted Pokemon to branch out of its comfort zone for years now.

———

TL;DR - Team Rocket is, for lack of a better term, our rock. For the longest time that rock was Brock, so without Brock, we needed Team Rock. But without Team Rock, and without Ash and Pikarock, there’s no one left to be a rock! We have NO ROCK! We need a sturdy rock to hold us steady, keep us stable, and light our path to a brighter tomorrow. A radiant beacon of hope for the future of the anime!

And I do NOT mean Martin’s stupid Solrock!

So Team Rocket, PLEASE come get some R&R at wherever we are watching the new kids on the poster making their dreams come true, Paldea or otherwise. You may not have a Pikachu to fail at catching, but I can think of a couple cool dinos you could go after instead! You’ll probably still fail, but that’s fine! We love you for it.

I think Mewtwo wouldn't let just ANY trainer command it, why not the one who not only opened its eyes to the values of human life AND saved its life from Team Rocket? Besides something tells me their bond would result in Mega Mewtwo X

*Latias:*
After saving her from Annie and Oakley, Latias was shown to completely trust Ash (to the point of having a crush on him), plus he's shown to be able help her Mega Evolve.

*Azelf:*
Azelf seems uniquely connected to Ash, as it contacted him in his dreams, and Ash was also able to feel its pain.

The next team has arrived!,0,zozqq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zozqq7/the_next_team_has_arrived/,8,1671373414.0,"Hello! Sorry for the time delay, I asked for confirmation and haven't yet received it. So what I'm going to do is post this and if my friend changes their mind about me making it ill delete the post. On that note, this is the second team. This is based on a friend of mine with their (at the time of posting) permission. Let's get in to it!

Member 1) Smeargle. If you couldn't tell, this friend of mine is an artist. Therefore, I believe Smeargle would not be a hard choice for them to add to their team. I can see them using this as their partner Pokemon that they'd bond with at a younger age, partially due to the less battle heavy side of Smeargle.

Member 2) Obstagoon. Another thing they like a lot is music. Since Obstagoon is based off Kiss, I think this would be an easy choice for them. They'd probably catch it as a Linoone, due to finding it at an older age, before then evolving it.

Member 3) Unfezant. This would be caught as a pidove, due to the fact that pigeons are common in the city we live in. However, they'd find Unfezant useful as transport, allowing then to fly to places like school, saving loads of time and energy.

Member 4) Huntail. This would be caught as a clampearl at the beach, but this would all happen because of a prank. Attempting to evolve it in to Gorebyss, one of their friends would trick them in to using the item for Huntail instead. They'd be upset at first, but then warm up to Huntail and appreciate a lot of its attributes, such as the pattern on its body.

Member 5) Delphox. This would be a 16th birthday present, as that's the legal age of starters in Kalos (I'm assuming this would be the case in France). Since the starters would be very popular, and France is known for arts, I believe their parents would get them a Fennekin for their 16th, which they eventually evolve in to Delphox.

Member 6) Ampharos. This is simple: we have a lot of sheep in the UK, so I think they'd inevitably get one. In a choice between Mareep and Wooloo, I think they'd go for Wooloo. They'd eventually evolve it in to Ampharos, and have hopes someday to go to France in order to obtain a Mega stone and keyring in order to obtain the even more majestic Mega Ampharos.

So in summary, my friend's team in real life, in my opinion, would be Smeargle, Obstagoon, Unfezant, Huntail, Delphox and Ampharos. Again, sorry for the wait and if this gets deleted I'll put up a post notifying everyone of it. For now though, thanks for reading an have a great day. See you tomorrow!",2022-12-18 16:23:34

ALRIGHT TRAINERS: TIME FOR YOU TO TELL ME YOUR TEAM🪱,10,zozc1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zozc1l/alright_trainers_time_for_you_to_tell_me_your_team/,26,1671372194.0,"As the title says, if you were in the universe of  Pokemon, why don't you tell me what your team would be, and why? Are you an average Gen 1 enjoyer? Or an individual who likes poison types? Tell me!! Maybe also, what region you'd like to live in, or you're job, just stuff about you, in the pokemon world! I'll go first:


*Goodra(Ace)

*Toxicroak 

*Alolan Ninetales

*Alolan Raichu

*Rotom

*Glaceon


Let's start off. I'd have Goodra as my ace, because not only is it super cute and huggable, plus one of my colors, it's a pseudo legendary that is pretty strong imo, and it's a dragon type! Toxicroak is next, because I am a fan of poison types, Croagunk is such a cute little boi and evolves into such a cool frog lizard thing! Alolan Ninetales and Raichu, love them both, I have a soft soft for Ice types and love regional variants, including the majestic Ninetales and the free flowing Raichu. Next is Rotom, in which I have to say, Ghost types will always be my fav, and Rotom is super interesting to boot, in changing it's type depending on the appliance. Hopefully we get more variants in the future :'( And last is Glaceon. Best Ice type and Eeveelution there is. Plain and simple!

Like its a poke clone game that did a really good job. Alot of key features changed or are missing, no battle tower, it feels incomplete (some stores have interiors some dont). Its like everything they got right they took 3 steps back. Everything that was removed or changed have been key features for almost the entirety of pokemon. Some good some very bad.

I’d love to see a Pokemon game where the region’s Champion is your mother!,9622,zoye7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zoye7p/id_love_to_see_a_pokemon_game_where_the_regions/,642,1671369338.0,"Basically the title! I’d like to see them write the story in such a way that your mother was the region’s foremost Champion for several years until she became pregnant with you, following which she semi-retired to take care of you. As you grew up, she taught you the ins and outs of Pokémon battling using her own super powerful team, which explains your character’s prodigal talent. You can then split the story in two ways:

1. Once you turned 9, she re-entered the competitive battling scene and fought her way to becoming Champion again, and now she watches over you as you and your rival begin your journey with the Pokémon she gave you.

2. After you turn 10, get a Pokémon and find yourself a rival, she finds herself longing to recapture her past glory and sneakily takes on the gyms around the same time as you, reclaiming her role as Champion shortly before you’re ready to take her on.

I always find that the mums of these games are underused, so this would be a lovely spin on the idea!",2022-12-18 15:15:38

Hot Take: Exploring towns is my least favorite part of Pokemon games and i’m glad it was simplified.,126,zoy9s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zoy9s9/hot_take_exploring_towns_is_my_least_favorite/,75,1671368963.0,"To me, even when the town had a gimmick and/or history to learn about, it always felt like a tedious and boring chore. The only reason I made the effort is because the OCD completionist in me felt compelled to check every nook and cranny in case there were important items or story moments somewhere, however for the most part i’d just be walking into 30 different buildings where there’s a guy standing alone in his own living room that says some shit like “My favorite food to eat on a hot day is ice cream! Yum!” And also, though they probably didn’t make the change for this reason, not being able to randomly enter people’s homes finally makes the games realistic in that regard. Yes, I suppose they could’ve had interior buildings for stores and restaurants since we DO enter those in real life, however with the sheer amount of stores and restaurants it would probably only serve to be the same empty time wasting filler to have to do that, with the same “one pointless sentence” NPCs.

So yeah, I don’t miss any of this and i’m glad it’s been streamlined. I actually wish they removed the last of the “press a button to talk to this person” NPCs and they were all the ones that have the dialogue automatically pop up as you pass them.",2022-12-18 15:09:23

Charizard is Inspired by European DRAGON

Cyndaquil = Porcupine, Which is a Rodent, Same as The RAT

Fennekin = Fox, Which is Canidae, a biological family of DOG.

Skeledirge = Crocodile, which is Reptillian, Same as a SNAKE.

Snakes once had Appendages, And so Did The Snivy Line which loses its Limbs upon Evolution.

I Think the Reason Gamefreak Went with a Crocodile is because they also did one Previously as a Starter and in gen 8 we got a Reptillian Water Starter as well

Starters in Alternate Types:

Bulbasaur, Swampert & Froakie = Frog, Reptile/Dinosaur

Squirtle & Turtwig = Turtle, Also Reptiles.

Totodile & Fuecoco. Crocodiles

Treecko & Snobble. Reptiles

There are also other Starters that get Re used such as:

Birds, Marine Animal such as The Otter & Sea Lion & Extinct Species.

Clearly a Formula & Patern are being Utilized & I can without a doubt guarantee that untill Generation 12 this Trend will Continue & we will see 3 more Fire Starters that Resemble (no matter how farfetched)

I was thinking about how cool it would be if, instead of getting a faithful remake, instead older regions got a new sequel. 

Like for example in Kanto, maybe Professor Oak is retired and instead Professor Blue gives you your starter. Maybe you start in a different city like B2W2. The gyms have also changed with different types and new leaders. And maybe familiar faces like Misty or Brock show up as Elite Four members.

But it would mean not being able to replay your favorite region as it was with updated graphics and on the Switch. You wouldn't necessarily see all your old favorite characters again. And callbacks to the original version might not be as impactful to new players.

That's it. That's the story. Which is good because putting the final part of a story in a DLC is objectively terrible. From a moral standpoint.

The DLC will be a sidequest.

I say this because there's a weird number of people that think that there's more to Geeta and that she's secretly an evil mastermind or something.

The reason is, of couse, because she's such unbelievable garbage that people want to believe that she'll be redeemed. This is what we call copium.

This is bad because there have been plenty of cases where people headcanon absolute nonsense and then when the headcanon is proven false, they say that the product is bad purely because it isn't exactly how they wanted it to be. 

So, please stop setting yourselves up for disappointment and accept that Geeta is just a terrible character.

The DLC will probably have some completely new, never before seen character that will tell us to go find the 3rd legendary. And that's perfectly OK.",2022-12-18 14:09:49

And overall I can't think of anything else, so they may be the only ones! (Please correct me if im wrong)

I'm only general chemistry 1 student so idk much but here goes:

1) Nacli line - Na(+)  + Cl(-)  this is the formula for --> NaCl which is the table salt you and I and everyone eats and lives thanks to. I saw many comments point out the 'i' in Nacli may be for Iodine - some table salt brands are sold with iodine (which is important for life as well. I think many of us may not get enough of it - aint sure tho, so take it with a grain of Nacli).

Pretty cool stuff

2) Glimmet and Glimmora - From bulbapedia:

"" ... may also reference copper(II) sulfate, a toxic inorganic compound taking the form of blue crystals. Its flower-like characteristics may specifically be a reference to the copper(II) sulfate hydrate chalcanthite.""

3) Gholdengo - made of gold, so basically elemental gold. 
His ability, Pure As Gold, specifically reads:
""A body of pure, solid gold gives the Pokémon full immunity to other Pokémon's status moves.""

So a pure gold body and immunity to statuses.  Maybe the status immunity is based on some of the element's characteristics - would love if someone with knowledge could shed some light.


4) Any other chemistry related mons? Also, what new chemistry pokemon you'd like to see?",2022-12-18 10:09:38

Now, none of them are permanently consumed, and are simply 'used' for battle. Give a terrain setter the matching seed, or a squishy pokemon a Focus Sash, tossed an item with Fling? It'll be back after you finish the battle. Berries are excluded from this since they're outright consumable items that you can also use from a menu, which is kind of eh but even the super-effective cutters or rare stat booster berries aren't that hard to get a hold of in this game.

The whole theme of finding your treasure really sticks with you throughout the entire game and you really resonate with your protagonist. The characters as well were amazing: Nemona, Arven, Penny, Clavell, Larry, So many great characters. I also love the student theme in this game being as I am currently in college myself so it’s nice to have that in.

now the only real major issue with these games are of course the technical issues in terms of frame rates game freezing and all of that however if you look beyond that these games are amazing I have not had this much fun with Pokémon before and I hope Pokémon continues with this open world open zone formula that they have since Pokémon is now on a home Console I feel they have much more ideas and much more potential than what they could do before. I hope Scarlet and Violet get dlc because the game left me with a lot of unanswered questions.

But realistically speaking...are any of the games actually difficult. I have been playing since Gen 3 and have played every game (except for Sun and Moon, yet), and even as a kid I never ever thought that any of the games were difficult. of course some of the games have difficult fights like Ultra Necrozma, Ghetsis in BW, Cynthia, Whitney, and Volo. But those are just difficult fights and are small in the grand scheme of the whole game. Besides, there is also just the fact that we are all just smarter and older players. We know type matchups, ideal moves to use, natures, tips and fancy tricks. Even if that knowledge is at an elementary level, you are well equipped to take on every single Pokemon game and have an easy time with it. So maybe we all need to cool it with the idea of SV is too easy and shit, bc realistically ALL of the games are easy and it is MEANT to be considering it is a kid-centered franchise that just so happens to have a lot of older players who are just smarter. 

NOTE that this isn't me dismissing the idea of wanting to implement a hard mode, cuz difficulty modes are great ways of adding replayability/freshness to a game.

Scarlet violet anime theory : The new unnamed male protagonist is Ash's son,1,zoq0o7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zoq0o7/scarlet_violet_anime_theory_the_new_unnamed_male/,8,1671338078.0,"Hey guys so as you know a few days ago we received some sad news that Ash Ketchum is officially leaving the anime : ( I was completely shocked at this news, Ash was the best character in the series and the anime wouldn't be the same without him and pikachu, but then again I think it's probably for the best as he did kind of achieve his dream of being a pokemon master after winning the master class tournament and with how OP he is now he'd probably breeze through the Paldea league. It's a pretty sad to see the anime's lead star retire from the roll, I'm gonna miss ya ash and pikachu : (

&#x200B;

But anyways I have a little theory of the announced Scarlet violet anime that's coming out next year. As you know there's gonna be two unnamed trainers taking over the role of ash and pikachu, and I had this thought in my head ever since I saw the concept poster. What if the unnamed male protagonist was Ash Ketchum's son? In my little theory the Scarlet and Violet anime takes place years after the events of the finale of the Sword and shield anime and the now adult Ash Ketchum  has become the strongest trainer in the world and moved to the Paldea region to settle down where he eventually got married ( to either Misty or Serena) and had a son ( as he does kind of look a bit like ash). And his goal is to become the new champion of the Paldea region so that he can get one step closer to reaching his dream to surpass his old man to become the next pokemon master.

&#x200B;

So what do you guys think? Do you think the new male lead could possibly be Ash's son? Or if Ash could reappear in the anime as an adult?",2022-12-18 06:34:38

My personal theory on Bisharp evolving into Kingambit is because the Tinka line exists. 

Just hear me out, specifically in Tinkatuff’s Scarlet dex entry, they assault families of Pawniard and Bisharp. Adding to this, while Tinkaton’s dex entry doesn’t outright say it, it does say that it attacks and plunders whatever it wants (Violet). I severely doubt this plundering is exclusive to Corviknights given their pre-evolution’s entry. 

One day, a Bisharp probably had enough and while asserting dominance in their respective colony probably evolved into Kingambit as a means to better fend off the Tinks. Kingambit only exists in Paldea because their placement on the food chain was greatly threatened… by a Pokémon exclusive to Paldea: Tinkatink/tuff/ton.",2022-12-18 06:14:04

Porto Marianda's Auctions,197,zoo4ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zoo4ez/porto_mariandas_auctions/,21,1671332054.0,"   I have been resetting the Auctions for quite awhile now (over 2500 at time of writing this) and wanted to share some of my observations and testing. The main items I and, I assume, many people want from this are the Apricorn and Dream Balls (sadly no Beast, Sport or Safari). 
   For those who don't know you can reset what is at the auction by simply closing and reopening the game. If you buy something close the game move the day forward and then reopen. It is worth noting that they also reset when a new in game day starts, which is every 72 minutes. For this reason it is, in my opinion, worth it to roll back the time so that you stay on the same in game day. This prevents a new day from occurring thus eliminating the chance something you will want will be rolled away on the new day. I usually start when it is daylight in game and once it becomes dusk I roll the clock back 35 minutes.
   The opponents all have a maximum bid that scales with age and seems to change depending on the category of item. I didn't test this with many items though.
   Now for my thoughts on each category of item 

- Healing items. These items are already cheap and generally don't have much use in this game to begin with. Especially post game. 

- Regular Pokeballs. Pretty much the same as the healing items, just not worth it. The exception here is Premier Balls. These can be bought in large amounts and for insanely cheap. 

- Sandwich Ingredients. The story repeats itself, nothing here worth grabbing. 

- Feathers. These are interesting. I didn't really buy them as I have a lot from raids, but I could see them being useful to pick up. 

- EV Reducing Berries. These are great. Very cheap (under 300 each even with the worst opponents) and are usually sold in high amounts. 

- Vitamins. I personally don't think these are worth buying. However as long as you are buying a large amount of them and don't have the older people as an opponent you can get them for about a 5%-15% discount. I just don't think it's worth the time investment. The highest amount I've seen for sale is 30 and lowest is 3. 

- Evolution Items. I think this is a good place to get these. Relatively quick and cheap. 

- Bottle Caps. These are terrible, NEVER buy these from the auction. 

- Special Balls. Alright here's the good stuff. These are extremely expensive so I hope you have millions to spend if you want a decent amount of them. They are also the rarest items only appearing about 1.5% of the time. Now these I know the exact maximum bid for each opponent. (Tho this seems to very a bit of they have dialogue before the bidding starts)
Child - 200k
Young Adult  - 220k
Middle Aged  - 245k
Older - 355k

Those window-dressing npcs that you can't talk to in Castelia City, thats basically 90% of the NPCs in S/V,

There is a small hand-full of NPCs in these towns with actual dialogue,

There is Zero Houses that you go into in the Big City with the school

I can't believe, I'm in the position, where I'm saying that Pokemon Sword and Shield actually felt more immersive to an extent,

there was a level of immersion that came from those cities,

at least it felt like, I was in actual city in S/S, a small miniature version of city though, but at least felt like the people were there, you can go into houses and talk to NPCs, and they'll talk about game mechanics, funny dialogue, a family eating dinner etc.

So in relation to this, I've had trouble thinking of designs for these pokemon and so I wanted to reach out and see your thoughts.

You see, the legendaries I mentioned before are meant to represent sickness and health - the poison type legendary spreading disease wherever it went while the fairy type would cure and heal those inflicted by the poison legendary's disease with this resulting in the two legendaries frequently coming into conflict and ending each other.

The two kinds of Pokemon (poison and fairy) would be called Plague Pokemon and Cure Pokemon respectively. Plague Pokemon will have a Ill and or toxic motif, while the Cure Pokemon would have a protector (like a knight) and or a healer motif. So I've already got a motif in mind but I'm having trouble thinking of ways to design the chosen Pokemon to fit these motifs. I originally chose these pokemon with the mindset ""hey, this pokemon might be cool with this sort of motif""... Without an actual plan in mind as to what they'd actually look like. I mean, I've already got Bisharp (Cure Pokemon) handled a bit by making him more resemble a knight, Lapras looking sick and spewing toxic gas out of its shell but that's about it really, and a few other small ideas.

So, I would really like the help from my fellow Pokemon fans when it comes to figuring out designs with some suggestions.

It's honestly one of the coolest Pokémon period, in a lot of ways. While it's somewhat simple, combining a Praying Mantis and scythe like arm blades, the scythe like arm blades awesome and the design itself is very detailed and well colored by Gen 1 standards.

If you were expecting me to have a contrarian hot take due to how clinically I described the above, well. Heck no, I LOVE Scyther! It's an awesome looking badass Pokémon who stands the test of time, and it's a flying type which is one of my favorite typings! I love the sheer speed this thing conveys and the way the ""slashing"" aspect of air is conveyed in the portrayal of it's attacks, the colors are vibrant, and it truly looks like a creative blending of it's two types that isn't the conventional ""hurr durr it's bug flying because it flies"" that many Flying types sadly fall under.

I also really like the creativity of it's evolutionary line creating separate but equal Pokémon. The format is great and seeing Scyther, Scizor and Kleavor side by side really makes me appreciate every member of the trio more than I otherwise would have - Scizor in particularly isn't quite as good as the other two in my eyes, but I can appreciate it more for the design variance. They almost feel like they could be an anime protagonist trio, and I'd watch it.

If there's anything to complain about at all, I guess it'd be that in comparison to my other favorites, it still struggle to differentiate itself sometimes - since it's very closely tied to it's animal inspiration, entirely green, and not super colorful. As a result, it gains a respectable **A- Tier** standing!

\----------------------------------------

Man, I wish I could include fanart today there's a lot of good ones for Scyther. Ah well. Do let me know what you think of Scyther though in the comments! And I'll see you all tomorrow, for uh... a rather controversial one.

"Unpopular Opinion: I actually think it's awesome that Ash is leaving, and that it elevates every episode of the anime that came before it.",1477,zokr5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zokr5g/unpopular_opinion_i_actually_think_its_awesome/,155,1671322707.0,"I am an original Genwunner kid. Like a lot of other genwunner kids, I watched this show in the 90s from the beginning, although I didn't stay dedicated to it (and like a lot of others, Hoenn was basically my dropoff point). I watched some of the movies but not much of the daily episodes. And just like a lot of others, when I saw scenes like Butterfree in the flashback for Pikachu, I couldn't believe just how reliably I was tearing up. Don't even talk to me about JN136.

One of the reasons that me and a lot of the other original Pokemania kids dropped off though is because it felt like the series was just endless eternal youth Ash where nothing would ever happen or change and the repeated league defeats reinforced that - it felt like an endless treadmill being extended forever and ever, with constant character resets or rugpulls so there was no point being interested in anything, and a lot of this felt like it was tied to the need to have Ash be a 10 year old underdog forever and ever. (Also, Ash definitely wasn't universally popular with Pokemon fans at the time, hence all the popular comparisons to the complete-fanfiction-invention of Edgy Silent Badass Red - mind you, during the true heights of pokemania, I couldn't tell the difference, and me and everyone else on the schoolyard assumed you fought Ash at Mount Silver and just pretended it didn't say Red because we didn't know who that was).

It's hard to care about all the album songs about Being A Pokemon Master Who Is The Very Best or Always Aiming For Your Ambition when it's pretty clear that this is just never happening, and every episode will just say ""To Be Continued"" forever. I think I realize now that as a kid, hearing the songs on the 2BA Master album promising that some day, there were plot threads that would be resolved. or things would actually happen, made me actually expect things to... happen. I'm pretty sure I had no tension for when Ash got to the Pokemon League because ""He's the main character obviously he will win"" and then Charizard said ""It's Charizarding time"" and Charizarded all over the place. There have definitely been a lot of other reasons why so many fans just rotated out (just aging out, the next series being disappointing), but everything staying the same and never changing was definitely a big one.

That's why I was actually thinking the stuff happening in BW anime sounded cool! Team Rocket but competent? Ash confronting Giovanni? Charizard is back?! I hadn't been keeping up with the idea that Ash was actually progressing as the show went on because as a kid it 100% did not *feel* like it no matter how much objective evidence the fans had about how much closer Ash was getting in the conferences, because Ash Was In Top 4 Before He Lost For Bullshit Reasons or whatever didn't strike me as weird, among the other complaints people had about BW. (Then later I watched some of the episodes and compared it to some DP, Kanto and Johto ones and uhhhh didn't stack up as well as I hoped lol - especially not to XY).

Now not one of those criticisms matters. None! It's not endless to be continueds and resets, there actually was a clear line of progression and improvement that lead from Top 16, Top 8, Top 2, Regional Champ, and then Being The Very Best Like No One Ever Was. Instead of an endless treadmill of resets, there are now promises of actual closure of things you had to give up on as a kid because the cast kept rotating and resetting (and we've already gotten some big ones). Everything that came before wasn't just pointless filler, but was leading somewhere.

Ash having a story with a conclusion elevates him, the entire show, and everything else around it. It makes his character more valuable, his story more worthwhile, and the same goes for the story of everyone else who'll be involved. There is something that's really, genuinely deeply exciting to me about the notion of ""The Pokemon Anime Finale"", something that you assumed probably could never be real, especially given how we've already seen some of what that looks like with Butterfree's return, the cap reversing coming back, the Ho-Oh callback, and more, so given how much actual closure of 25 year old emotional wounds or long hanging threads they've already started offering, I can't wait to see what else we get.

The stuff that they've been doing towards the end of Journeys has been the sort of thing that's only possible, that can only have as much impact, because of the more than two decades of hanging threads, unfulfilled potential, and deep childhood nostalgia and impact. Suddenly, those expectations I had of the story as a kid aren't just childhood fantasies, suddenly there's a promise that things will actually happen, and have been happening. It's rare that any franchise gets to play with this sort of thing, in ways that people really never thought they'd get, and I honestly can't wait to see what else we get. To me this is far far far far far more than worth it. I will take one Butterfree Returns To Pikachu's Flashback moment over a million extra episodes of new regional series.",2022-12-18 02:18:27

Tinkaton   carries its 220 pound hammer with just its arms, and it doesn't jump   high while using Gigaton Hammer, but it jumps high when climbing up its   hammer to sleep, which probably means that the hammer is weighing it   down. Corviknight has that 220 pound metal from the hammer all over it's   body, and it flies with the damn metal of all things, even carrying   passengers in a heavy trolley back in Galar.

What   it does to take down the corviknight as stated in it's take is that it   hits rocks with it's hammer like a baseball bat, and in corviknight's   dex it says that tinkaton endangers the PASSENGER, not the corviknight.   It probably runs to the unconscious corviknight, takes off its armor,   and hauls ass out of there trying not to get its ass kicked. The   corviknight probably won't even be unconscious for long, hell, might not   even be unconscious but weakened temporarily from the sudden massive   damage, because corviknight is not weak to rock, meaning tinkaton has   very limited time to get that armor and get the hell out of there.

Maybe if you do well enough you could even be promoted to the elite four!

2. Easy/hard mode. The game has as many adult players as it does children. The developers still seem to focus on kids and it takes minimal effort to actually beat the game. Introducing a hard mode could allow battles with trainers to use better strategies rather than just being some hurdle.

I evolved 1000 Tandemaus and am here to tell you why you're probably just getting unlucky. [Warning: LOTS of maths talk inside],366,zoimge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zoimge/i_evolved_1000_tandemaus_and_am_here_to_tell_you/,54,1671317263.0,">**Premise:** I posted on r/PokemonScarletViolet a week or two ago about the incredible run of bad luck I was having trying to find a Maushold Family of Three (Fo3). I had hatched 250 eggs without a Fo3 and was seeing way more success with evolving wild Tandemaus. I had begun to suspect that contrary to popular belief, there WAS an inherited component to Fo3 success. I vowed to evolve 1000 total Tandemaus and report back. BEWARE: my math is probably bad, it's been a decade since I've seriously done stats. I'm sure much more complete comparisons could be done by a math whiz, but I'm a simple hobbyist!

***TD;LR: If you haven't got a Tandemaus Fo3 after several hundred tries, you're probably just unlucky... but \*maybe\* there is a higher Fo3 rate when breeding from a Fo3 (probably not).***

# Section I: Raw results

I obtained 1030 Tandemaus through three methods: 1) Breeding from a random Family of Four (Fo4) 2) Catching wild and 3) Breeding from a Fo3. All Tandemaus were evolved using the built-in exp share in groups of 5, so the evolution animation was not triggered. Below are the total results I observed.

||Fo4 Evolved|Fo3 Evolved|*Total*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Wild Caught**|297|3|***300***|
|**Bred from Fo4**|399|1|***400***|
|**Bred from Fo3**|324|6|***330***|
|***Total***|***1020***|***10***|***1030***|

It took me 367 Tandemaus bred from the Fo4 group to find a single Fo3. This single Tandemaus does thankfully suggest that Fo3 can come from any breeding parent. I was skeptical for a while there.

# Section II: Probability of Outcomes

Operating under the assumption that every Tandemaus has a 1/100 (1%) likelihood to evolve into an Fo3, here is the probability (p) of getting each of these specific results using the [binomial distribution formula](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/binomial-theorem/binomial-distribution-formula/):

* 3/300 Wild Caught: p = 0.2252
* 1/400 Bred from Fo4: p = 0.0725
* 6/330 Bred from Fo3: p = 0.066
* 10/1020 Overall: p = 0.1255

Fun! Nothing inherently meaningful about those probabilities, but still interesting to see.

# Section III: Testing is Fun!

Now comes the testing part. Using [Chi-Square Tests](https://www.jmp.com/en_be/statistics-knowledge-portal/chi-square-test.html), we can compare the likelihood that any of these groups are meaningfully different from one another, or the likelihood that our results would happen if every Tandemaus had the same likelihood of evolving. You can do a lot of different comparisons with these results, but I've tried to include the most meaningful in this section. Most calculations have been skipped, and you'll have to forgive me

***GOODNESS OF FIT (GoF) TESTS (comparing results vs an expected 1% chance of Fo3)***

||GoF X^(2) Value|Probability (DoF=1)|Significant (a=0.05)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wild Caught|0.000|1|No|
|Bred from Fo3|2.231|0.135|No|
|Bred from Fo4|2.272|0.131|No|
|Overall|0.088|0.925|No|

This is the most important section of our testing. **None of these results are statistically significant, suggesting that all of these outcomes could be reasonably expected if the probability of evolving any Tandemaus into an Fo3 is 1%. Dang! So much for cracking the code.** Some of the individual groups have lower probability, but our overall results were nearly perfect with expectations. But wait! There's more testing we can do\~

***GROUP v GROUP TESTS***

We can also compare any two of our Tandemaus groups to determine the likelihood that these results would occur if they have the same rate of occurrence. For example, if I wanted to see the probability that our ""Bred from Fo3"" group has the same rate as our ""Wild Caught"" group, I could run a X^(2) Test based off of the comparison of their raw results above. In that example, our X^(2) value would be 0.747 for a p-value of 0.387. This does NOT give us reasonable evidence to reject the idea that these groups have the same rate of occurrence. All of the group-to-group comparisons are in the table below:

||X^(2) Value|Probability|Significant (a=0.05)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wild Caught vs Bred from Fo4|1.697|0.193, DoF=1|No|
|Wild Caught vs Bred from Fo3|0.747|0.387, DoF=1|No|
|Bred from Fo3 vs Bred from Fo4|4.682|0.030, DoF=1|**Yes**|
|All three groups compared|4.629|0.099, DoF=2|No|

**Take note here: there is some evidence that the rate between the groups ""Bred from Fo3"" and ""Bred from Fo4"" might not be the same. Our probability is statistically significant in that head-to-head comparison!** However, when we add in the wild-caught group in a three-way X^(2) test, our null hypothesis remains relatively unlikely but the statistical significance is lost. Most likely this means that the probability is the same, but leaves *some* room for doubt.

# Section IV: Conclusion

**The takeaway here is simple: if you've been hatching and evolving hundreds of Tandemaus without finding an Fo3, you're probably just unlucky.** There's not a lot of evidence that this is anything other than a simple 1/100 chance. **We have a little bit of evidence from this data that the rate of Fo3 may be different (higher) when evolving offspring bred directly from a Fo3, but** in context of the other lack of evidence (goodness of fit tests, three-group chi-square test), **I would ultimately be willing to hypothesize that this is not the case**. More testing could be done on evolving from Fo4 parents vs Fo3 parents to make a more confident determination.

***If you read this far:*** *Why? I know I wasted my life on this, but you really didn't have to. I wrote this for those other wayward souls who have horrible luck Fo3-hunting, like myself. Hopefully this gets enough visibility where they can find this analysis and have peace knowing that someone out there crunched the numbers to show that there is not a cosmic conspiracy against them. Also, feel free to reach out if you want a Fo3 Maushold.*

I figured ""Wally"" was short for ""Wallace"" and I was so confused when I got to the E4 and found that Wally had grown his hair out, had a personality transplant, aged twenty years, and also become the champion, all during the time it took me to get through Victory Road.

Pokemom nostalgia,2,zoi079,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zoi079/pokemom_nostalgia/,0,1671315672.0,"I only discovered Pokemon around the end of 2019. Yes you read it correctly. Well I knew it existed, I was just never really aware of it until 2019.
I can't even remember how it happened, something just clicked and I became fascinated. I found sites where I could watch the original series and spent days binge watching each episode, growing fonder and fonder of the series. 
Eventually I wanted to partake in the pokemon games and managed to find an emulator online of the gen 3 games. I was elated! Though it was just a pixelated 2d game, it felt so wonderful to play.
I swear I was like a Pokemaniac for a whole year. Managed to binge the series up until Hoenn was introduced, then life got busy and my obession faded.
I still love Pokemon to this day very much so! I even bought my first pack of trading cards not long ago.
I feel connected to a whole generation I never got to know and it's a wonderful feeling. It's like experiencing a childhood you never had.
Pokemon is a wonderful genre and I'll never froget the joy and excitement it had sparked within my soul.

You HAVE to run for your life and dodge attacking pokemon to escape. As you just barely make it out your save by the Flare Corp. who promise to be a light in this stange new world. To award you for your bravery and compassion you're given a starter. The main game is to find all the Zygarde cells and to complete the Pokedex. The core acts as a scanner and indicates when a cells is nearby.

The big bads are team Growth who seek to use the full resources of the world to expand and team Cull who seek to rid the world of the bad and vile. Both are seeking Zygarde not knowing you already have them. They each find Xereas and Yveltal respectively and cause a great apocalypse. The only unaffected place is center of the region where you found Zygarde and must use Zygarde bring back balance and reverse the teams' mistake. In the end both teams agree that neither's philosophy is foolproof and learn to co-exist.

To balance the game, the weaker Zygarde forms could be buffed like the uncombined cells are encouraging Zygarde to become whole and fight.

Do you prefer Legends: Arceus or Scarlet and Violet?,7,zohs5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zohs5r/do_you_prefer_legends_arceus_or_scarlet_and_violet/,10,1671315100.0,"Legends: Arceus easily for me. I find the gameplay loop far more addictive. The act of real time catching is just so fun, and adds more interaction in an open world. This is important for open world games, and I’m disappointed it’s absent in Scarlet and Violet.

But, Scarlet and Violet reintroduce online battles, as well as just more battles overall. And when the game isn’t glitching, it can look really nice. I think PLA has the better art style (excluding the models) while S/V has the better execution in terms of graphics.

On a gameplay level, the fact that S/V is so incredibly slow and doesn’t have real time catching is very disappointing. I feel like PLA had a bigger focus on the Pokémon themselves, which is huge. That’s why I play the series.

I think if we took a map as amazing as S/V’s, PLA’s gameplay loop (real time catching and battling), and just added more trainer battles we’d have the best of both worlds. The only thing for me really missing in PLA is more battles, but even the free update fixes that and is incredibly fun. 

Don’t get me wrong though, I enjoyed Scarlet and Violet, very much so. But I hope in future games, they add real time catching again, which single handedly is probably my biggest disappointment and takes away a lot of play time.

Something seems off about Geeta,481,zoh7mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zoh7mq/something_seems_off_about_geeta/,135,1671313651.0,"Ok, so I saw the post about none of the other gym leaders really liking Geeta, I've seen posts about her champion team being disappointing, and it all feels really valid. She wasn't that strong a champion, she made obvious tactical errors, and in-game she doesn't seem revered as a champion outside of Nemona. 

I was just grinding some evolutions in the very bottom of Area Zero, and I noticed how many Glimmora were in the area. Glimmora feel very connected to two things: 

There is a clear connection to Glimmora and whatever is causing the Terastilization phenomena, they are very common at the impact site, and seem to be a similar crystal form to the tera orbs and crystals in Area Zero. They may be closely related to whatever the third legendary is, either created directly by it, or being some sort of lesser form of it. 

There is also a very distinct connection between Geeta and Glimmora. It is her ace pokemon despite being a much better lead than a close, Nemona comments on it being rare and being a pokemon Geeta has in Area Zero, and she even has her hair styled to look similar to it. 

&#x200B;

With the post-game discussions with Arven admitted that the story he was told doesn't make sense, I think Geeta is involved in some sort of cover-up with whatever is really happening in Area Zero. She has a connection through Glimmora to the area, a position of power in the region, and with the conspiracy theory vibes given by the books, I think it would make a lot of sense for her to be revealed as a villain in the DLC. 

She'd have an excuse to have a much stronger team, there'd be a great character moment where Nemona would find out the truth about her hero, and they've already established in-game that a lot of the best trainers in the region don't like her. Geeta being the final villain would both be an excellent subversion of expectations for a region's champion, and a great pay-off for a lot of subtle hints in the game so far. I wouldn't be surprised at all if she was involved in the accident that lead to Sada/Turo's death. 

I feel like they're hinting at a lot of things, and Geeta having a dark past and a full villain turn directly related to Area Zero just makes a lot of sense to me.",2022-12-17 23:47:31

I'm posting the rules here in case anyone wants to give it a try

Rules:

•the challenge begins as soon as you gain access to Tera Raids

•You are limited to using Pokemon with Tera types that don't match their standard typings (ex: you can use a Toxel so long as its Tera type is neither poison OR electric)

•You are limited to a single Tera Raid or wild Tera Pokemon per province area (south province area 1, area 2, etc), but you may check each raid/pokemon and the Tera types and then choose one

•You may catch as many Pokemon as you can with the pokeballs given to you by Nemona and that you find in the over world, but you cannot buy additional pokeballs until after the challenge starts
  -These pokemon can be used for Surprise Trades in the event that an area has duplicate pokemon or Tera types, ineligible pokemon (pokemon where Tera type matches standard type), or you lose all eligible pokemon in battle and have none left in the box
  - You may do as many surprise trades as needed until you receive an eligible pokemon

•Basic nuzlocke rules (nickname, faint=death, one per area) still apply. Additional clauses like shiny clause or no healing in battle may be applied per your discretion",2022-12-17 23:32:00

I am not sure if I want to play Scarlet anymore at this point. I hope they fix Tera Raids. I just started getting great at taking down Charizard with my Dachsbun. (Rain Dance/Misty Terrain/Snarl/Drain Kiss is a really potent combo for Dachsbun since Charizard only is able to Hurricane with Dachsbun's ability and typing). But the five and six star raids seem to be the worst offenders. Why is 7 star easier despite supposedly being more challenging? Maybe GF will listen maybe not.

Despite the huge revenue these last Pokemon games have made for the pokemon company,

There hasn't been a Pokemon within the last few years that is treated as a ""You must play it!""

Like you would say that this game is a Killer app that you would see breath of the wild and being highly prasied.

The last Pokemon game I remember that highly praised for certain features and being a killer app when it came out were the Black2/White2 games, but the DS games have very minute changes in its improvement.

the problem is the Pokemon Company (GameFreak, Creatures, and Nintendo themselves) only see the Pokemon Games as by-products for other media. Like these games aren't treated like games that need time to cook, but Juggernaut Advertisements for  the anime, the manga, toys, merchandise, and the card games.

Like the reason why Pokemon has so much longevity amongst older fans is things like Nuzlocke; adding spin on things to make it more interesting.

Despite how Big Pokemon is, There hasn't been that Sacred Cow for Pokemon since like DS games, but even then thats a stretch imo

The Academy Ace Tournament kind of sucks,25,zog0zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zog0zg/the_academy_ace_tournament_kind_of_sucks/,11,1671310642.0,"Don’t get me wrong, I like the idea behind it. Battling the teachers that you only interact with in classes is actually really cool (even though I didn’t bother with most of the classes because of how boring and pointless they are aside from the History class). Being able to rematch Nemona, Arven, Penny, and Clavel is also really neat (even if I’d rather you be able to just go to them and fight them like the Star leaders). 

But the replayability of the tournament is VERY lackluster imo. It’s not challenging since all of their Pokemon are levels 65-71 when most of us are probably rocking ev and iv trained lv 90-100 mons for raids at this point. The actual number of trainers in the tournament is really small at only 13, so they repeat very often. You can’t even fight any of the elite 4 other than Hassel, and none of the gym leaders are there. 

And the worst part is that the rewards themselves are VERY underwhelming. Most of them you can already get from raids or just picking up random items in the world, with the only good ones (gold bottle caps and apricot balls) having just a 1% chance of appearing! When it takes ~12-15 minutes per go (since we can’t even skip animations anymore) it’s just not worth doing when the rewards are either already easier to get and more plentiful by other means or when the odds of getting the better ones are almost impossible. 

They should have had the gym leaders and other elite four members in the tournament as well, along with additional modes like Doubles and competitive scaling to maintain a sense of challenge. They should have also done a system where you earn points that you can redeem for the different prizes like bottle caps and the apricorn balls. What I’m basically saying is THE ACADEMY ACE TOURNAMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE BATTLE TOWER. It’s absolutely baffling to me that they got rid of such a longtime feature (ever since Gen 3) when it has never been easier to get into competitive team building, and the tournament is frankly a terrible substitute if you can even call it that. The novelty wears off very quickly after steamrolling Hassel for the 3rd time in 4 runs and only getting some mints for my efforts.",2022-12-17 22:57:22

As the title says, anyone else feel like it's super easy to catch legendaries?

I remember the DS games, where I would literally take 10-20 minutes, use up ALL my ultra balls, maybe even having the Pokemon struggle itself to death. I don't remember swsh as I didn't really care for that game, but even bdsp and pla was harder. At least pla had you doing a mini anime dodgeball battle with Arceus and then you still had to catch him.

Gen 9, you just have to roam around at your own tempo and collect swords. I've only went for chien pao as I like his design more, and it barely took less than 5 ultra balls. I caught my second koraidon with 2 ultra balls attempts and a final timer ball. Ever since they added that stupid guaranteed catch mechanic, it takes the fun and stress out of catching legendaries.

I don't even bother saving before an encounter, or stocking up on balls. I have like 10 ultra balls left in my bag. I don't even have to use status moves. I remember having to keep a Pokemon with paralysis or freeze, now I just slap them with any move and catch them at red.

Is it just me, or did GF and the Pokemon company cater to the kids and noobs more so literally anyone and their Gramma can catch these legendaries?

What Pokémon do you want to see get an evolution or regional variant?,7,zoeoue,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zoeoue/what_pokémon_do_you_want_to_see_get_an_evolution/,16,1671307179.0,"I'll start with my list:

\-Fearow: deserves a regional variant. It's the only one of the gen 1 birds that still hasn't gotten anything and it's pretty week.

\-Arbok: Give it a regional variant. Considering Muk and Weezing got something, Arbok is next in line.

\-Parasect: Give it an evolution. I love the concept but the Pokémon is ridiculously weak. Its evolution could be  a Bug and Ghost type.

\-Seaking: Blandest fish ever. Please make it evolve.

\-Kangaskhan: Please, just make the baby in its pouch a pre-evolution

Tauros and Miltank: Isn't it about time they get a common pre-evolution?

\-Meganium: Typhlosion got something, so it's unfair that Meganium and Feraligatr still don't have regional variants. And considering Meganium is super weak, it's in dire need of one. I could see it being grass/fairy.

\-Delibird: Give it an evolution. Iron Bundle doesn't count, as it is a separate species.

\-Lanturn: It's cute but horribly weak, please make it evolve, but don't change its typing.

\-Magcargo: Give this thing an evolution with a steel shell, that would be a great way to buff it.

\-Ledian: Please give it a third stage. Bug/Fighting would be pretty fitting even if I know we've had that combo several times already.

Sunflora: Give it a Grass/Fire third stage. It's so weak that it deserves something. Also, I'm not a big fan of Scovillain, so I definitely think we need a better Grass and Fire type Pokémon.

Ariados: I think it deserves a regional variant.

Jumpluff: I know it's already a third stage, so give it a regional variant. I would love to see them reuse the beta design that looked like a cat. They could make it a Grass/Dark type or Flying/Dark type.

Noctowl: It has pretty weak stats for a regional bird. Please give it a third stage.

Furret: Please give my favorite early route normal type Pokémon the Obstagoon treatment: regional variant+regional evolution

Swellow: Same!

Kricketune: Deserves an evolution

Carnivine: Make it evolve! I also think its evolution should be immune to Bug.

Chatot: I love bird Pokémon, but Chatot is so small and weak. Make it evolve, already!

Do you agree with me? Or are there other Pokémon you can think of? I'll be waiting for your replies!",2022-12-17 21:59:39

Tips for the 7-Star Charizard Raid,19,zoejh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zoejh3/tips_for_the_7star_charizard_raid/,15,1671306778.0,"I've run this raid a stupid number of times and have a pretty good handle on how to win it as consistently and quickly as possible. Here are some tips that could help you out.

* Charizard removes debuffs from himself at the start of the fight after he uses Overheat, and then *never does it again*. This means any debuffs you stack on him will stick for the entire fight. You can easily exploit this to drop his special defense down with Fake Tears or neuter his attacks by dropping his special attack with something like Spirit Break.
* Charizard will remove your buffs when he puts his shield up, which I'm fairly certain is the only time he does it. This means if you spend your first few turns spamming Calm Mind while other teammates are attacking and proccing his shield, you've wasted those turns. Unless your team is coordinating an OHKO strategy with Sylveon and Hyper Beam, save your attack cheers until after the shield goes up.
* Raid pokemon can't be affected by status moves like Fake Tears while they have their shield up. This is why if you have special attackers on your team you should stack Fake Tears ASAP. I've seen way too may players waste turns because they don't realize this. This is also what makes moves like Spirit Break really good because you can continue to stack debuffs even through the shield.
* *Pay attention to what actions your teammates are taking and choose your own actions accordingly*. This will help prevent you from wasting turns trying to put up Light Screen after a teammate already used it or clicking Fake Tears after your teammates already minimized Charizard's special defense. If everyone is using Fake Tears and you see a Sylveon using Calm Mind, *don't spam attacks at Charizard*. Use attack cheer instead and so it will be OHKOed by Hyper Beam.
* If you're using Sylveon, don't spam Draining Kiss when you have full (or close to full) HP. Moonblast, Hyper Voice, and Hyper Beam deal way more damage and will end the fight sooner. I've lost or almost lost raids due to Sylveons being way too passive by only using Calm Mind and Draining Kiss for the entire battle.
* Sylveon, Flutter Mane, and Grimmsnarl are the best pokemon to bring by a large margin. All have access to Fake Tears so they synergize well together, while Grimmsnarl has excellent support options. Azumarill is decent and better than most other pokemon, but can be very squishy and does less damage overall than Sylveon and Flutter Mane can, which makes the fight take longer. I've actually started abandoning raids when more than once Azu queues in. Blissey is decent support as well, but doesn't have as many tools as Grimmsnarl. The fastest, easiest kills I've gotten were with teams of two Sylveons and two Grimmsnarls. Dachsbun is straight up bad. There are probably other pokemon that can work, but make sure whatever you bring is level 100 and isn't straight up weak to Charizard's attacks (fire moves, dragon moves, Hurricane, Focus Blast).
* Please, please, please don't use Rain Dance. Sure, it weakens Charizard's fire moves, but (and I'm not sure everyone realizes this) *it boosts Hurricane's accuracy from 70% to 100%*, so you're likely hurting your team more than you're helping. The only time it's not completely terrible is right after Charizard uses Sunny Day, but there are other ways to play around this (Skill Swap, Light Screen, special attack debuffs like Mystical Fire or Spirit Break).
* As alluded to above, be strategic with your cheers. If your teammates are all at low health, you should probably click heal cheer instead of Play Rough again. If Charizard's shield is getting low, click attack cheer to help your team break through. Heal cheer also clears status effects, so if everyone is burned or confused you can clear them all at once with a heal cheer.

So, I've been thinking about scarlet and violet's new paradox forms and I gotta say.. it's like regional variants with a whole new twist and I love it.

I really love the concepts and hope they do more based on the time that these Pokémon were around. But that left me wondering... what would you choose as Paradox Forms for each game?

Considering Switch is one of Nintendo's best selling consoles, maybe GameFreak would release gen 10 on Switch. Or maybe cross platform like Gen 2 of Pokémon (Game boy/Game boy Color) or Zelda: BotW (Wii U/Switch)

Assuming gen 10 will come out in 2025, that doesn't seem too impossible imo. Especially if they upgrade the hardware of the Switch.

Somewhere in there people also often criticize the old JRPG style of the combat system that hasn't seen any real improvement or change since Gen 3, when abilities were introduced. I think we can all agree that was a minor change to the system at best.

But what type of combat system would you introduce if Game Freak asked you to design a new combat system for the mainline games? 
Would you keep it turn based or try to venture into a more action oriented fighting game? Would you make changes to any of the core ideas?

How do you feel about the amount of gameplay that's tied to the fighting system? Would you reduce it and introduce different systems that make use of the different varieties of Pokemon?

Almost all of the X/Y mega eligible Pokémon are already in game.

The new game play mechanic in Terastalization, isn't a form change mechanic.nor does it conflict with the held item slot that would allow mega evolution.

We are a stones throw away from Kalos, with the area connecting the two marked in the same way that Area Zero is on the map.

Next year will be X/Y anniversary, and if the pokemon company is willing to put off a secondary spin off release between then and now. (As something like legends Arcues or let's go) They could quite easily build the map of that region within a year's time. Be it if they are going that far, it most likely would have already been in development before the games release.

That and if they were making a Kalos expansion, it would kind of make sense why there isn't much in the way of character cloths customization at the moment. So they could sell it back to you latter on in the region that established such.

I knew that Yawn was a prior evolution move only, but I figured since Skeledirge already knew Yawn then it would be okay and it would still remember. But nope. 

So does this mean that if a move can only by learned by a prior evolution, if it’s forgotten when the Pokémon has evolved it can’t relearn it?

Im interested to know what is the difference from scarlet and violet too

The games look like fun and im interested in starting to play more story games as-well, since im used to playing mostly call of duty.

I have a nintendo switch (if it matters)

Any insights would be greatly appreciated",2022-12-17 18:54:13

That one move... (very mild S/V spoiler),0,zo9sts,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo9sts/that_one_move_very_mild_sv_spoiler/,3,1671294058.0,"Why exactly is Make It Rain a special move? Pay Day's a physical move. I get that Goldengho is a special attacker, but why couldn't it be a physical attacker? It would work as a physical attacker, it doesn't particularly scream 'special', nor 'physical' either really, so it all comes down to Make It Rain in the end, and for whatever reason, Make It Rain is special.

Even if Goldengho absolutely had to stay a special attacker for some reason, it's not like Make It Rain necessarily has to be special as well, Heatmor is a special attacker (or, at least, has a little higher special attack), but Fire Lash makes sense as a physical move, so it's a physical move.

I don’t usually seek help online for game problems, but I’m not sure what else to do at this point. Any guides I’ve found online for the 4 legendary treasures don’t mention this, and I just want to see if I’m just being unnecessarily dumb when I don’t need to be.   
So, Ting-Lu. The earth vessel of ruin. I’ll be blunt; Is it literally impossible to catch it with a non-master pokéball? For context, I’ve beat the entire main game and done all the crater stuff. I’ve weakened Ting-Lu’s health by a ridiculous amount, barely a sliver left, most I can at this point just shy of killing it. And it’s asleep. I’ve tried with these EXACT conditions more than 30+ times, unsuccessfully, to catch Ting-Lu with a variety of Pokéballs. (keep in mind, I’m more than 10 levels above it!) I’ve tried great balls, ultra balls, quick balls, all of it. Dusk balls have seemed to work the best, but literally every time Ting-Lu’s managed to break out at the last second. Maybe that’s just a testament to how stubborn I am with video games, ha…

Anyway, I just came here to ask, simply, this. Am I just being stupid? Am I supposed to let Ting-Lu faint completely first, before I can catch it? Can I not catch it at all? To anyone who has completed the postgame before, i need advice. Thanks in advance.",2022-12-17 18:08:52

How the Pokédex SHOULD work,132,zo94w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo94w9/how_the_pokédex_should_work/,19,1671292282.0,"Video version [here](https://youtu.be/owOuwQCwwE0). I recommend with the visuals. 

Alola, Alola everyone. The Pokédex has gone pretty unchanged for the last 25 years, both surprisingly and unsurprisingly. Let’s be real – when it was introduced in 1997, it did a pretty darn good job of what it was supposed to do. But nearly 3 decades later, I’m hoping for a little more out of it. After all – It is the high-tech encyclopedia Professor Oak was gassing up. We’ve seen the Pokédex do so much more in the Anime leaving viewers to hope that one day they can use their own Pokédex just like Ash does. I’m Techno, and here’s how the modern Pokédex SHOULD work.  

**1.)**  
From an information perspective, the Pokédex is awfully lacking. I love to read the tidbits on the Pokémon species, don’t get me wrong, but we need more. Players often have to rely on fanmade websites or projects to inform them of things they’d otherwise never find out, like evolution methods or breeding mechanics. That’s why the Pokédex should have a page of information regarding species details.  
Pressing X on the Pokémon’s data screen could allow you to visit the Statistics screen (seen in the video!). This screen could inform you of how this Pokémon evolves and what Egg Group it’s in.  
This page could also show base stats, but I feel GameFreak would be a little resistant on showing base stats in number format. After all, in old official guide books, they were always listed vaguely in meter format. There could also be a section dedicated to Learnset, where you can see the Pokémon’s moves it learns leveling up, helping you plan around the future.   
  
**2.)**  
The Pokédex could also use more fluidity. In fact, Scarlet and Violet’s Dex interpretation seems to be the clunkiest of them all resulting in a very unfriendly user experience.   
From the Dex home screen, the user should have the ability to skip mass amounts, a feature seen in previous games anyways, with the L and R buttons. There should also be a Search function – something that already exists in the box menu – to help you find that Pokémon, Ability, or Egg Group you need quicker.   
On the topic of fluidity, Imagine you’re looking at the Statistics screen mentioned before (example in video!) and you’re interested in seeing more Pokémon of the same Egg Group. Hover over with the cursor and choose that option to see the list of Pokémon compatible. Or choose the Pokémon it evolves into to skip over to its page.   
  
**3.)**  
Another thing the Pokédex could improve on is focusing on a Pokémon more than just catching them. Pokémon Legends Arceus laid the groundwork out for this ideaand I think it should continue in future iterations. Each Pokédex Entry could have a 0-3 Star rating.  
Pressing Y on the Pokédex screen could open up the Study Quests. In this theoretical suggestion (again, seen in video.. :D) , you would have a set of quests that involve interacting with the Pokémon more. For instance, to get the first star for a Pokemon you simply have to catch it, but for the second star you can take a picture with it, or see it use a move in battle. Complete three quests to get a 3-Star ranking.   
There could be some incentive to it too – Getting a 3 star ranking grants you a sticker of the Pokémon that you can place on your trainer card, increased shiny odds for this Pokémon specifically, and maybe the ability to change the PokéBall for this species!   
  
**4.)**  
Remember in the Anime when a Trainer would see a Pokémon in battle and requests information from the Pokédex on it? We should be able to do that too.   
Imagine on the battle screen there’s an option for Pokédex, and choosing it allows you to open up the Battle Dex screen. This can tell you the opposing Pokémon’s Type, what it’s weak against, Abilities it can have, if you currently own one, and maybe more. This could help Trainers learn the relationship between Types better than just being told a move is super effective from the move selection screen.   
  
The Pokédex isn’t bad, really, it’s just a little outdated. Okay maybe the one in Scarlet & Violet is bad, you did a terrible job Mr. Jacq. <.< I hope one day to see these three features implemented into the game. Let me know in the comments what else you think the Pokédex should be capable of!",2022-12-17 17:51:22
Looking for ideas for a highly themed container for a Pokémon gift,5,zo91py,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo91py/looking_for_ideas_for_a_highly_themed_container/,3,1671292042.0,"I'm hoping this doesn't get removed because I think this community may have some great ideas for me!

My husband and I are both very into Pokémon, starting with Sun/Moon. When the 7km ""friendship eggs"" got added to Pokémon Go, my husband became obsessed with getting an Alolan Vulpix, but was unsuccessful for a long time. I decided to purchase him an Alolan Vulpix plush and give it to him in a 7km egg that I made myself. I used a yellow plastic easter egg and painted pink spots on it, and gave it to him after a particularly long day he had at work (as if he walked long enough to hatch the egg that day). It was a massive hit and they are both now on display in our house.

Now, with Scarlet/Violet, he LOVES Fuecoco. So much so that I got him a 9 inch Fuecoco plush for his desk at work for Christmas. The thing is, I would love to gift this in a unique way like I did the Vulpix, but I'm having trouble thinking of something.

I thought about putting it in a pokeball, but I can't find one big enough. I would be willing to paint one myself but I also can't find a plastic sphere big enough, either. I also thought of putting it in a ""live animal"" box (like when you adopt a cat), but that doesn't feel very themed.

Can anyone here think of a themed/creative way to present this plush? If you were receiving this, what would you think would be a cool way to get it? I think if anyone would have some unique ideas, it would be you guys!",2022-12-17 17:47:22

1. The last time we ever got something like this was with Pokemon Yellow, over two decades ago (excluding the remakes, and sticking to the franchise's main genre).
2. Since Ash's journey has finally realized its conclusion, one of my first thoughts was that we'd see an adaptation of his many, many adventures throughout the anime's 25-year and continuing lifespan (plus the movies if possible) in the form of a Switch game.
3. It may not have to be all eight regions on one cartridge; it could be split across up to 8 of them (one region a cartridge).
4. This could also double as a recap on Ash's bizarre, unique, colorful adventures over 25 years, in the timespan of a JRPG or eight.

And I was wondering if you people would help me bring it back. I hope this works as this well bring me lots of memories back

How do I make Scarlet/Violet more challenging for myself without doing a nuzlocke?,3,zo5nnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo5nnp/how_do_i_make_scarletviolet_more_challenging_for/,29,1671281427.0,"My biggest problem in pokemon has been how easy the games are. I've tried doing nuzlockes to make them harder, but I didn't really enjoy the format of a nuzlocke(i tend to get really attached to my pokemon and losing them feels really unsatisfying in the long run).

What if X/Y had a challenge mode? Part 3 Rivals and Others,0,zo5mdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo5mdg/what_if_xy_had_a_challenge_mode_part_3_rivals_and/,1,1671281292.0,"Third part of this What if Kalos had a challenge mode. There’s a couple of terms I’m putting here just so I don’t have to individually write “team if you chose Chespin and Charmander” half a dozen times:

Eeveelution: The eeveelution that the rival uses which changes depending on your starter. Chespin = Jolteon, Froakie = Vaporeon, Fennekin = Flareon.   
SS: The starter that is strong against the starter you chose at the beginning of the game.   
WS: The starter that is weak against the starter you chose at the beginning of the game.   
SKS: The starter that is strong against the Kanto starter you chose. If it is Charizard, it’s mega will be X in X and Y in Y.   
WKS: The starter that is weak against the Kanto starter you chose. If it is Charizard, it’s mega will be X in X and Y in Y.

Anyway, I’m basically adding Pokemon to teams and boosting levels to conceptualise a harder Kalos that doesn’t go overboard.

Enjoy:

Shauna 1:
WS (6)

Not really much I can change here since it’s literally the first battle of the game after both of you get you first Pokémon.

Sycamore 1:
Bulbasaur (11), Charmander(11), Squirtle (11), Ralts(11), Gible (13)

Gave him Ralts since it evolves into one Pokémon that can mega evolve and another that can’t at this point so he’d be interested to research it and Gible because of the anime.

Tierno 1:
Budew (11), Fletchling(11), Corphish (13)

Just gave Tierno his other Pokémon early.

Tierno + Trevor
Fletchling (15), Roselia (15), Pikachu (15), Flabebe (17), Corphish (17)

I wanted to make this a full team of 6 but I couldn’t think of a Pokemon I could give Trevor early so this is what I got.

Rival 1:
Meowstic (30), Fletchinder (30), Absol (30), SKS (32), SS (32)

Both starters are in stage 2. Gave them the Kanto starter strong against yours because it made sense (why do you get a Kanto starter and they don’t) and kept the Fletchling they had during the catching tutorial and multi battle (mainly because facing a gale wings Talonflame sounds like hell and I love it).

Rival 2:
Mega Absol (33), Meowstic (33), Fletchinder (33), SKS (35), SS (35)

Both Starters are in stage 2. The rival gets to use mega evolution now and tries it out with Absol.

Rival 3
Meowstic (38), Talonflame (38), Mega Absol (38), Eeveelution (38), SKS (40), SS (40)

They get their eeveelution plus Talonflame and the two starters are now fully evolved.

Rival 4:
Meowstic (48), Talonflame (48), Absol (48), Eeveelution (48), Mega SKS (50), SS (50)

Now the mega is the Kanto starter they use.

Sycamore 2:
Venasaur (56), Charizard (56), Blastoise (56), Gallade (56), Mega Garchomp (58)

Gallade because it’s related to a Pokemon that can mega evolve but can’t mega evolve itself at this point and Mega chomp because anime.

Trevor:
Raichu (55), Tyrantrum (55), Aurous (55), Florges (57), Mega Aerodactyl (57)

Uses the two fossils in the battle Manson and already uses an Aerodactyl so the mega was obvious.

Tierno 2
Hawlucha (55), Ludicolo (55), Roserade (55), Crawdaunt (57), Mega Kangaskhan (57)

Uses Hawlucha in the battle Manson, replaced Talonflame with Ludicolo since I thought it fit him better and Mega Kangaskhan because he looked after a Kangaskhan in the manga plus I think it would be a good dancer.

Shauna 2:
Delcatty (55), Sylveon (55), Goodra (55), WS (57), Mega WKS (57)

Uses Sylveon in the Maison and it made sense to give her the last Kanto starter.

Rival 5
Meowstic (65), Talonflame (65), Altaria (65), Absol (65), Mega SKS (67), SS (67)

Replaced the Eeveelution with Altaria. 

AZ:
Shedinja(70), Probopass(70), Torkoal(70), Golurk(70), Sigilyph(70), Mega Alakazam(72)

Gave him a level boost of 10 because otherwise he’d be about the same level as the last rival fight and this is after the elite four. Gave him Shedinja since he’s also kind of dead inside, Probopass because it’s another ancient Pokémon and Mega Alakazam due to it looking like an old wise sage.",2022-12-17 14:48:12
What if X/Y had a challenge mode? Part 2 Gyms and Elite Four,0,zo5lom,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo5lom/what_if_xy_had_a_challenge_mode_part_2_gyms_and/,1,1671281215.0,"Second part of a What if XY had a challenge mode. Basically I’m adding Pokemon and boosting levels. In the case of the gym leaders and elite four, for the most part I tried to give them a Pokemon from Kalos and also a Pokemon that can either become a mega now or in ORAS.

Enjoy:

Viola:   
Surskit (11), Spewpa(11), Beedrill(11), Vivillon(13)

Shame that Kalos only added one bug type family. Added Beedrill since Scizor and Heracross are probably a bit much for the first gym and it Beedrill does get a mega in ORAS.

Grant:    
Binacle(26), Onix(26), Amaura(26), Tyrunt(26)

I hate giving him Onix but he uses it in the anime plus Steelix does later get a mega so it fits. Went with Binacle since he lives next to the place where you find them the most.

Korrina:    
Machoke (31), Mienfoo (31), Pangoro(31), Hawlucha(34), Mega Lucario(34)

Gave her Pangoro since it’s gen 6 and it think it fits better than Chestnaut and Mega Lucario since she literally has one. Also I’m aware that you’d be facing a mega before you get it in this case but that’s kind of the point, to show you how powerful it is.

Ramos:    
Jumpluff(33), Victreebel(33), Trevanent (33), Gogoat(35), Mega Venasaur(35)

Went with Trevanent and Venasaur since I thought they fit the gardener ascetic pretty well. 

Clemont:   
Dedenne(38), Lanturn(38), Magnezone(38), Heliolisk,(40) Mega Manetric(40)

Dedenne because Gen 6 electric, Emolga for Lanturn because we don’t need 2 pika clones on 1 team unless it’s Plusle and Minun, Magnezone since you can literally evolve Magneton next door and Manetric since I thought it fit also I need the other electric mega for someone else.

Valerie:  
Mr Mime(42), Slurpuff(42), Aromatisse(42), Sylveon(45), Mega Mawile(45)

Thank you to Valerie for already having a Pokemon that can go mega. Went with Slurpuff and Aromatisse since there not used too much and she uses a spritzee in the anime and Slurpuff is mind off Aromatisse’s counterpart.

Olympia:  
Sigilyph(49), Slowking(49), Malamar(49), Meowstic(52), Mega Medicham(52)

Malamar because Gen 6 psychic that I think fits better than Delphox and Mega Medicham because I have plans for Alakazam, Gardevoir is Diantha’s and the other psychic megas are legendaries.

Wulfric:  
Mega Abomasnow (65), Crygonal (62), Mamoswine (62), Vanilluxe(62), Avalugg(65)

Again thank you Wulfric for already having a mega capable Pokémon (why didn’t you use it in the game) and I added Mamoswine and Vanilluxe because I thought they fit him.

Elite Four

Malva:  
Torkoal(69), Pyroar(69), Chandelure(69), Delphox(69), Talonflame(71), Mega Houndoom(71)

Mega Houndoom because anime and Delphox because she apparently has an important one in the manga.

Wikstrom:  
Klefki(69), Escavalier(69), Probopass(69), Aggron(69), Aegislash(71), Mega Scizor(71)

More people having mega capable pokemon and not using them. Also Aggron and Escavalier since they kind of look like they’re wearing Armor which matches Wikstrom. 

Drasna:  
Dragalgie(69), Altaria(69), Druddigon(69), Garchomp(69), Noivern(71), Mega Ampharos (71)

Mega Ampharos since the other dragon megas are taken, legendary or haven’t been introduced yet and Garchomp because she’s from Sinnoh so she should have a dragon from Sinnoh imo.

Siebold:  
Greninja(69), Clawitzer(69), Starmie(69), Gyarados(69), Barbaracle(71), Mega Blastoise(71)

Greninja because Gen 6 water + frogs legs and Mega Blastoise because anime.

Diantha:  
Roserade(72), Lapras(72) Aurorus(72), Mienshao(72), Goodra(72), Mega Gardevoir(74)

So Diantha. She has a reputation for being the easiest champion so I decided to try to remedy it a bit by changing her team slightly so she doesn’t have as many shared weaknesses while still keeping her ascetic of beauty. Hawlucha for Mienshao, Gourgeist for Roserade and Tyrantrum to Lapras should make the team a bit harder.",2022-12-17 14:46:55
Favorite Female Pokemon Professor,5,zo5kjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo5kjn/favorite_female_pokemon_professor/,13,1671281101.0,"In my humble opinion, Professor Burnett is the best.

The way Burnet is a superfan of Kukui's alter ego, masked royal is incredibly adorable. The way she blushes at the idea of meeting him. I already liked Kukui, because of his endearing relationship with his wife. 

I also really liked Sonia, She's got an energetic design, a history with Leon, a cute as-hell Yamper,  and the way she twirls her hair is cute. She even managed to uncover Galars secret history that Swordward and Shieldbert covered up. Even though the lore was not that deep, it's still fantastic that Sonia uncovered it.

What if X/Y had a challenge mode? Part 1: Team Flare,0,zo5hj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo5hj3/what_if_xy_had_a_challenge_mode_part_1_team_flare/,1,1671280800.0,"So X and Y have a reputation for being one of the easiest games in the series and for a good reason. It’s easy to get overleveled due to the Exp All, you get given multiple powerful gift Pokemon, trainers don’t use that many Pokémon, you can use mega evolution but only about 2 bosses in the main story have it, etc.

So I decided to try to make a sort of what if challenge mode for XY. I focused on the team flare bosses, gym leaders, elite four members, rivals and other important characters. I’m also separating them into 3 parts because of Reddit’s character limit. I mainly did the same thing Bw2 did by adding Pokemon to teams and boosting levels. They’d also obviously have better movesets and items but I’m not an expert on what those should be so I decided not to mention them.

Part 1 is team Flare because one of them caused something that affected the other parts. This only contains the scientists and Lysandre since I don’t care about the generic admins.

Anyway, here they are. Its basically just the character, their team (with the pokemons level next to them) and some commentary from me.

Enjoy:

Aliana 1:  
Pumpkaboo(41), Diggersby(41), Mightyena(41)

She uses both Pumpkaboo and Diggersby in the manga so I threw them both in. Helps round out the team.

Celosia + Bryony:  
Manetric(45), Doublade(45), Granbull(45), Liepard(45), Persian(45), Whimsicott(45).

Anyone else wish we could have a 12 v 12 multi battle in the story some time? IDK, always felt unfair that both me and my partner have . Anyway Celosia had a Doublade in the manga and the others are Pokémon that Xerosic gives to his slave in the post game.

Mable 1:  
Houndoom(52), Mawile (52), Volcarona(52)

Another 2 Pokémon that Xerosic gives out. Went with these 2 for Mable since it makes sense to send the member with the most Pokémon strong against ice types to the ice cave.

Aliana 2:  
Gorgeist(52), Diggersby(52), Mightyena(52), Druddigon(54)

Anyone else find it dumb that none of the scientists use their strongest Pokémon when you first encounter them? Anyway, she now has her Druddigon and her Pumpkaboo evolved.

Celosia:  
Manetric(52), Doublade(52), Granbull(52), Drapion(54)

Drapion gets added, level goes up, that’s it.

Bryony:  
Liepard(52), Persian(52), Whimsicott(52), Bisharp(54)

Again Bisharp is added, level goes up. Same stuff. Wish Kingambit was added in this game.

Mable:  
Houndoom(52), Mawile (52), Volcarona(52), Weavile(54).

Mable is actually the reason why Team Flare is part 1. Reason being that in her second encounter, she uses a different, weaker houndoom (lv46 instead of 48 and early bird instead of flash fire). I thought this was stupid so raised her and the other scientists levels by 6 instead of 4 but that also ended up screwing with the level progression with the bosses following them so I just decided to raise the level of all Pokemon used by a character after the 7th badge by 6. Also Weavile is here.

Lysandre 1:  
Mienshao(53), Murkrow(53), Floette(53), Flygon(53), Pyroar(53), Gyarados(55)

Decided to give Lysandre Flotte/Florges and Flygon because when adding in Murkrow, he has 3 Pokémon matching the types of the Aura Trio (and in the case of Floette, it’s connection to AZ and the ultimate weapon). Also evolved his Mienfoo since it’s at the level where it would have evolved.

Xerosic:  
Crobat (52), Jellicent(52), Heliolisk(52), Malamar(54)

Jellicent was the last Pokémon that hadn’t been given to a scientist and he briefly held Clemont’s Heliolisk hostage in the manga so I went with that.

Lysandre 2:  
Mienshao(55), Honchkrow(55), Florges(55), Flygon(55), Pyroar(55), Gyarados(57)

Both his stone evolution Pokémon have evolved and his Pokémon are higher levelled.

Lysandre 3:  
Mienshao(57), Honchkrow(57), Florges(57), Flygon(57), Pyroar(57), Mega Gyarados(59)

His Pokémon are higher levelled and his Gyarados is now mega. So basically how it is in the base game.

Well that’s it. Hope it was a good read and I’ll see what I can cook up in part 2 and 3.",2022-12-17 14:40:00

If I had to pick his team I think I would have gone with:

-Pikachu
-Charizard
-Sceptile
-Gengar
-Lucario
-Greninja 

Good type balance with a good mix of old and new Pokémon. Plus most are fan favorites. I wanted to find a spot for infernape but just think Charizard has to get the edge. Interested to hear your thoughts!",2022-12-17 14:39:45
SwSh vs SV,0,zo5gdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo5gdg/swsh_vs_sv/,5,1671280674.0,"I had to put Scarlet down because of the graphics; maybe I'm old (30) but the glitches hurt my eyes after a while. I've beaten the game, I really enjoyed the finale of the story, but after catching a Pokemon that was behind a wall and I couldn't see it until after I caught it, I put it down.

I booted up Shield because why not, I thoroughly enjoyed those games. The difference in the graphics is ASTOUNDING. Everything in SwSh is pretty, the details of the flowers in the pots and the little market place in Stow on Side, i mean, the graphics are leaps and bounds ahead of SV. (I only mentioned the one place but the details in the graphics are everywhere)

Y'know I'm really disappointed. I liked Scarlet, I will admit it was fun, and Arven deserves the world. But. 

The level of the graphics, the staticness of the Paldean world, the reused skins and renderings plus the horrible frame rate for everything, I couldn't use Daschbun because he kept glitching into the ground every second when I put him into battle, the list goes onnn.

I've been playing Pokemon since the beginning, but this is it for me. Unless they fix it, I will not be buying another Pokemon game 💔

I know. Not exactly the most exciting or mind-blowing thing in the world... *at first.*

Let's not beat around the bush, pokédex entries gen after gen have some of the most batshit insane stuff written in them along with all kinds of weird, interesting tidbits and important lore and I love it, I LIVE for it. I mainly want longer dex entries just so we have more of all of that.

But also, I just feel like each and every pokémon has so much more to say about them beyond one or two small sentences that could certainly use some more room for expansion or some added context. I really don't know what's stopping them from doing this, if they've ever even considered it at all.

Is it for time related reasons or do they just prefer all the text to be visible on screen at once? Y'know, to eliminate that second problem they could just do this thing called saying ""Screw it."" and ADDING A SCROLL BAR already for goodness sakes. I forget, have any other Pokémon games actually done that with their dex entries or am I tripping?

Longer dex entries could also allow them to go way deeper (and maybe even darker) into what makes certain pokémon tick which can only be a good thing. Anybody else want this as much as I do?",2022-12-17 14:15:15

However I honestly, think that even more than the loss of Ash as the main protagonist, losing Pikachu as the mascot is not a good idea. Yes I agree that kids will eventually know whatever the new mascot will be - for a very large crowd, especially adults all over the world, Pikachu = Pokemon.

Be it Grandparents, Parents, People who have never seen an episode of Pokemon or played the games, they know Pikachu. Pikachu has ascended the Pokemon Franchise as a whole. Most people can only name Pikachu when asked to name a Pokemon.

Losing Pikachu and the recognition that Pikachu has brought to the Franchise isn't going to be a good thing, atleast in the short term. I am sure in the long term all changes take effect so this one will as well, but atleast in the short term - it's not going to be an easy switch.

In all honesty, I think they need to do a really good job with Rika and Roy to ensure that people like them because most people will start the show missing Ash.

Where I think they can go with Ash's involvement is by doing the following:

1. I can't really see Ash as a Good Professor and I think that the roll of just a champion or a Gym Leader/ Elite 4 will be too limiting for him. I would like him to have a more passive but recurring presence in the story.
2. This can be achieved by trying to integrate him into the story like Nurse Joy or Officer Jenny have been incorporated. 
3. The above can be done by creating a new system for the Pokemon world, which acts like a Repository fulfilling the functions that the Pokedex doesn't. As we know, the Pokedex gives us the complete info about a pokemon type and moves as well, but we don't really have something in the anime which acts as a reference for how different species and types Pokemon interactions with each other, both in the wild normally and during a battle.
4. Ash can be a good fit as someone who is trying to complete the above repository by catching all the pokemon he has missed up and until this point and just battling with them and living with them, recording their inter-species interactions. Obviously as a World Champion I am not denying the possibility that the young protagonists never fight him, on the world stage - I just want him to have a more day to day presence in the show, rather than an exclusive appearance.

That way our new protagonists can be guided by him time and time again along the road and slowly but surely we, the old fans of the show can come to terms to seeing that Ash is still on his own adventure, it's just time for us to move on to the new younger ones, while still meeting him along the way. I don't want Ash to suddenly become an absent figure in the anime, I think that will just remove a big part of what makes Pokemon the legacy that it is.",2022-12-17 14:10:26

Some years ago, I was part of community that revolved around a world of anthro pokemon. One of my characters was a ghastly morph where his head is the only consistently solid part of his anatomy, the rest of him was composed of gaseous vapor he can control the concentration of to touch or pick up objects as he saw fit. A friend of mine convinced me to dust off this old ghastly character of mine for some roleplaying (all of it safe for work, it's been mostly copying plots from films and seeing how our characters would respond/behaving being there, like if they found themselves among the team from the movie *'Kong: Skull Island'*), and I figured if I'm going to dust him off for use again, I might as well rework and refine some of his details, especially in a way that helps differentiate him from any normal, regular ghastly. Among some of the details (that admitingly didn't cross my mind to consider about before now) is his weight.

I know (regular) ghastlys weigh about .2 pounds, but should I make that his weight also since he's somewhat anatomically similar? Or should he be a little heavier since he isn't a feral ghastly? Maybe the weight of a human's head? I stuck, what do you guys think? What would you say is a fair weight for an anthropomorphic ghastly where his head is the only regularly solid part of his anatomy?",2022-12-17 13:41:57
"A Pokemon game concept, with all regions and full National PokeDex",1,zo4i3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo4i3a/a_pokemon_game_concept_with_all_regions_and_full/,5,1671276940.0,"So, I won't speak for anyone else, but I personally was quite disappointed when I heard of Dexit. Way later than it happened, because of how my interests cycle, but that's beside the point. Anyway, lurking on all of the posts and articles about the Scarlet and Violet, I couldn't help thinking about a game that would include all regions and the National PokeDex. From that premise, I ended up trying to work out how that could happen with more-or-less internal consistency, both in gameplay and narrative, while supporting features I'd seen desired.

I value adding options and variety, though I'm not entirely certain that these ideas do that in a way that many others would enjoy. But, I figured, I went through the effort of trying to fit these ideas together, I may as well share it and see what the reception and feedback is like. It's definitely not in ""complete"" state, but I hope the read is enjoyable, or at least, provides inspiration for other ideas.

(As an aside, I personally prefer the older isometric JRPG style environments and grid moving for Pokemon, but i know that's subjective. I also like open world games. My real desire is being able to complete the National Dex in one generation/console, the movement is far less important.)

The Concept:

An indeterminate time in the future, Pokemon Professors from around the world convene to share their latest research. The venue they've chosen is also hosting a Pokemon convention, with con attendees visiting from far and wide. When the villain group botches a theft of the research, several prototype devices interact in unforeseen and unintended ways, unleashing energy into the venue. Everyone at the convention is exposed to the energy, which alters them in various ways. Those closest to the source are affected the most.

This includes your player character, at this point you choose their gender and age category (child, teen, adult, elderly), as well as naming them. For convalesence and research of the effects, you are invited to travel with a one of the Professors to their lab - your choice of whom. As compensation, they offer you a choice of starters from their region. Another victim, coming with the same Professor, chooses another. You name this rival.

After arriving, initial tests reveal that the Player is healthy, but now attuned to energies previously thought exclusive to Pokemon. Musing that everyone at the con must have been similarly altered, the Professor encourages the Player to explore the potential of this alteration. Uncertain as to how, though, and knowing only that the alteration is related to Pokemon, the Professor (and related parties) offer these possibilities:
- Challenging the Pokemon League to become the region's Champion
- Filling out the Pokedex
- Investigating the villain team

As you travel through the region, battling, leveling, catching, and otherwise interacting with Pokemon, more about your change is revealed. Being in the vicinity of Pokemon utilizing the energies unique to them, you can absorb some of the excess radiation, and unlock ways to shape that energy to:
- Use HMs directly without teaching them to your Pokemon (field only)
- Invoke regional gimmicks such as Mega Evolutions, Dynamax/Gigantamax, Terastalization
- EXP Share toggle, per party slot
- Tracking/baiting/avoiding specific Pokemon (alter encounter and spawn rates)

Your rival shows up occasionally sometimes with messages from the Professor, other times to test themselves against you.

Final starter not chosen by the player or rival is stolen by the villain leader, who also was at ground zero. Over the course of your travels, the villain group tries to take advantage of this new phenomenon, kidnapping and experimenting on con-goers. Experiments include attempts to extract the energy, amplify the effects, and duplicate the incident. One encounter involves a lieutenant trying to put affected people into Poke Balls, throwing one at the player. It fails, but takes a worrying amount of time to do so.

Postgame: Pokemon League officials, utilizing the research on altered people, have devised a means for trainers to ensure equal battles. Battle participants who choose to agree to the settings they list in the device will have their capabilities limited and equalized. (level, gimmicks, items, etc.) The official explains that the device is meant to be voluntary, and to increase the audience appeal of League battles, not to force everyone to use it at all times. Having sent out the first few batches to gyms in each region, they want the player to take a device and go through the League Challenge in another region. 

After achieving the Champion rank in that region, the League official thanks the player for their advertising, and announces the creation of new National brackets. There are various tournament formats, and to qualify, a would-be participant must achieve Champion rank in at least one region. Winning any of the tournaments grants the title of National Champion.

I will happily explain the functionality of each one. And post multiple for the pokemon that can do several things. To save on effort I'll start by dex number. 

(It's kinda late so I will finish this tomorrow)

Vaporeon

Ability:(both work quite well here.)

Nature:Modest/Bold/Calm

Ev: Hp:252 Sp atk:252 Def/spdef:4

(alternate stat build if you want to focus more on bulk)

Ev: Hp: 170 def:200 Sp Def:140

(your attacking move will determine your terra type)

Shell bell/Leftovers

Moves:

Calm Mind

Fake Tears

Surf/Muddy Water/Ice Beam/Stored power

Acid Armor/Shadow ball/Ice Beam/Protect/Rain Dance(if you use Hydration over water absorb)

Vaporeon is a pretty general build with a simple idea in mind. Weaken in the first few turns with Fake tears then get a few calm minds before going in. The shell bell will likely give you a good recovery but the leftovers I've found work because they will trigger when the opponent takes an extra turn in raids. 

&#x200B;

Jolteon

Nature: Calm(for the added bulk. Jolteon is not usually bulky so this is kinda tricky.)

Ability: Volt Absorb

Shell Bell

Ev 252 sp atk 100 Sp def 150 hp

Rain Dance/Wish

Fake Tears

Calm Mind

ThunderBolt/Thunder

The pattern is quite the same but you can set up rain so thunder hits better, or use wish to hopefully stay alive longer. Please don't use thunder without rain dance.

Flareon

Adamant Nature

Ability:Flash Fire/Guts(Both can be viable)

Normal/Fire Terra Type 

Item: Flame Orb(for guts)/

Evs: 100hp 252 Attack 156 sp def

Curse/Double Kick

Fire Fang

Trail Blaze

Facade(if using guts)/Body Slam

Pokemon Battles in Mainline Games,1,zo2uoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo2uoy/pokemon_battles_in_mainline_games/,0,1671270121.0,"In regards to myself. I have been playing every single Pokemon since Pokemon Blue/Red and as such I am aware that Battles are an integral part of the experience.   
However, since I am playing for so long I have grown significant knowledge in regards to the competitive side of the Game and as such have grown tired of every single Mainline Games battles.   
Like why are we even batteling at this point anymore ?  
I played through the entire game and it felt like I had not a single Mon faint from Battle through it all.   
The Champ was a joke being beat with a mix of Fire and Bug STAB attacks and one EQ to send her ace down. On top of that I constantly had to check Gym Leaders Levels to not end up being totally overleveled.  
Even 6-7 year olds probably get bored eventually by this kind of stuff.   
Now besides Mainline Game I also played most spinoffs and a lot of them were really good and engaging from the Gameplay side like Conquest or Mystery Dungeon. I also played a lot of Romhacks/Fangames were the teams were build with a lot more care and thought put into them then here.  
So for myself I came to two conclusions on how to make new Pokemon Games more enjoyable in the future. Either you improve on the batteling, (which I am very much aware they will never do) or go the approach of Legends Arceus and focus more on the other aspects of the game like catching and exploration over batteling.   


For the first most already heard the ideas that they will never put in the game like:  
\- Allow for Gyms to be something other then Mono-type or if you stick to Mono atleast give them Coverage Mons that account for their weakness. Terastalizing was a chance for that, but they didn't pull it off properly.   
\- Give Trainer Mons more Held Items and I am not talking about comptitive Stuff like Choice Items, but rather simple stuff like a Silk Scarf or certain Berries that one may not expect. (Something that they kinda tried towards the endgame of the Gen 4 Remakes, though they messed up the progression to get to that point a bit)  
\- Give Trainers better Movesets. So even on an immersion Level we as the Player can use all the items that are everywhere and TMs, but not a single other Trainer in Paldea apparently can ?  
\- MAKE MORE DOUBLE BATTLES or alternate match types. Pokemon B/W and B/W 2 were great when it came to that. In general I think that singles Battles are fundamentally broken against the current Games AI, cause it makes it way to easy to setup sweep and the AI is not progammed to punish switching nor has it the ressources to do so in the form of it's poorly build teams.   
\- Introduce Difficulty settings. In case someone is worried that their children can't handle a game that would be more difficult (again look at the Challenge Mode in Black 2) it can be done.   


Like I can't be the only one that thinks it's tiresome when you sweep the Game, even when self-restricting with self-imposed challenge rules. Most of the Battles didn't feel impactful, cause of it. Neither knocking out any of the titans, Nemona or even the Champion. The final stretch felt a bit better, but still. Since the things I suggested will probably never be implemented again, should we take some of the lessons from Arceus and stop seeing batteling as the main gameplay draw ?",2022-12-17 11:42:01

Animals that look identical to other animals is not convergent evolution,0,zo1w01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zo1w01/animals_that_look_identical_to_other_animals_is/,44,1671266000.0,"Okay, everyone, post after post calling the new look alike pokemon as being similar to convergent evolution are wrong. That isn’t what convergent evolution is. Definition time from wikipedia. 

Convergent evolution - the independent evolution of similar features in species of different periods or epochs in time. Convergent evolution creates analogous structures that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups.


Mimicry - mimicry is an evolved resemblance between an organism and another object, often an organism of another species. Mimicry may evolve between different species, or between individuals of the same species. Often, mimicry functions to protect a species from predators, making it an anti-predator adaptation.

I included the definition of mimicry as I would say it is a much CLOSER real life natural occurance that these Pokemon could be representing. Convergent evolution essentially means different animals evolving into the same niche and therefore usually looking similar. They almost never look identical to the other animals, just similar, and also importantly, they have the exact same ecological niche i.e. they should have the same typing, same power, same move pool, it you wanted to show this in Pokemon. There are ALREADY pokemon that represent convergent evolution - Pikachu clones. Feebas and Magikarp. Heck maybe even all the Fire/Fighting starters could be called convergent evolution. Like…convergently evolved animals are not identical to each other. A common example of convergent evolution would be Flying squirrels, colugos, and sugar gliders. These different groups are not identical looking. Similar looking and with behavioral similarities due to similar ecological niches

However, mimicry often does involve an attempt to look identical to another species. It most often evolves as protection from predation (most common examples are usually non-poisonous animals evolving to look like poisonous ones), therefore their ecological niches can be very different (ie totally different typing). 

Listen if you wanted convergent evolution in Pokemon, it’s already there. Furret and Linoone. Medicham and Meinfoo. Corphish and Krabby. Route 1 birds. Similar typing, similar movesets, similar strengths and weaknesses while looking similar - That is a Pokemon-style convergent evolution. Just looking identical is mimicry.",2022-12-17 10:33:20

Introducing the first Pokémon to... so many things actually. The first non-normal type to gain Fairy, the first to have a period in the name, the first Pokemon to gain a pre-evolution, a regional variant, and an evolution... seriously, why did so many unique things go to Mr. Mime?

&#x200B;

**122 - Mr. Mime**

I don't have a unique opinion here. 

Many, many people complain that Pokémon are too humanoid and whatever, and while stuff like Machamp is exempt usually from Kanto, a lot of people still find Mr. Mime incredibly creepy. I love humanoid Pokémon, but Mr. Mime just looks like a complete and utter creep and I cannot tolerate him whatsoever. His hand gestures weird me out, he looks gross and unappealing, I just... no. Just no.

Part of that is me being squicked by how far the fandom has taken this thing. Most of it is just my innate reactions however.

However, despite the fact that the design is disgusting to me, I hate how well Game Freak is doing to force me to reassess my opinion of him. This... thing has good moments, I have to bring them up to do the write up justice.

Mr. Mime has an \*excellent\* implementation in Legends Arceus where it can put up barriers that block Pokeballs and must be snuck up on. And there's a fantastic sidequest which implements this ability by putting up invisible walls around Jubilife that must be navigated and all I can say is, more of this, please! You can't just tell me a Pokémon's attributes and expect me to like them, show it! Give more Pokémon their turn for things like this. Practically every classic Pokémon that appears in Legends Arceus will be elevated due to the sheer awesomeness of that game and all the details in it.

Also! Mr. Mime in the Detective Pikachu movie was hilarious. Full disclosure, that made me laugh. It was humor that revolved around Mr. Mime that didn't involve him being a creep, and almost managed to make me recharacterize my opinion of him entirely.

Between those two things... I can't say I *hate* Mr. Mime anymore. But I still don't like it's design, and that makes him go near the bottom of the **D Tier**, as a one to one comparison with any other Pokémon in that tier will make me choose the other one.

&#x200B;

**122\* - Galarian Mr. Mime**

Here's the hot take! This guy isn't creepy anymore. I like the way it focuses on dancing and it's legs in the animations instead of it's disgusting hands. Encountering this thing was one of the few Pokémon: Shield moments that stood out to me, because of just how fun it's animations are and how happy it always seemed.

It also gets to be more of my favorite colors, have a less awkward and more polished and modernized expression, and the Ice-type it receives is one of my favorites. All in all, I almost like this one. 

I think it goes near the top of the **C+ Tier.** It almost escaped to B Tier, but there's just a little too much Mime left in it for me to do that, and the hair looks a little ugly. But... I will say, Galarian Mr. Mime does at least lead into a darkhorse favorite of mine. It'll be a long time before I get there, but I'll let you know in advance - I am a Mr. Rime fan.

DAy 0,122: Mr. Mime!

Eugh -- I procrastinated this one a lot because Mr. Mime just.. *really* creeps me out. I've mentioned before that the too human Pokemon give me the heebie jeebies and Mr. Mime is one of the biggest reasons for that.

It just... I don't know -- maybe I have some weird phobia towards mimes? It just weirds me out -- and they're a holy terror on Legends! I just -- Mmph. I don't like it.

We won't even talk about the creepy theory about Mr. Mime being something more than just a Pokemon to Ash's mom -- *eugh*.

I will give it some brownie points in admitting that it's entertaining -- Especially in the Detective Pikachu movie. When the gimick of what it's based off of gets used for the jokes it becomes less scary -- And maybe I'm the only one that gets jeebed out, I don' tknow.

Honestly. I don't like Mr. Mime and have no qualms with putting it in the **F** tier.

**Galarian Mr. Mime:** Haha -- **A**? -- While it's Kanto form makes me feel uncomfortable and weirded out I get so happy seeing Galarian Mr. Mime. It does such a happy little dance that I can't hate it. I actually adore it quite a bit. Good vibes!

Ever since the episode ‘I choose you’ came out, Pikachu as the Pokemon mascot has been ingrained into everyone’s minds and that Pikachu represents Pokemon. And with Ash & Pikachu leaving, where do we go from here? Do we get a new mascot, or get a new Pikachu for the next protagonists? 

In my opinion, it would be far better if the anime introduces a new mascot. That most probably originates from the Paldea region. And I don’t think they will be the starters. I’m guessing it will be Pawmi. Let me know what are your thoughts.


Edit (18/12): So based on general consensus, Pikachu stays as the overall Pokemon mascot with regards to merchandise and marketing of the Pokemon brand. Pikachu has been synonymous with Pokemon that removing it as the main mascot will be a massive downturn for the franchise. Whereas for the anime and seasonal mascots will be the regional mascots. And for now, it’ll be a tie between Sprigatito and Fuecoco. Only time will tell on which one gets the best treatment.",2022-12-17 09:16:37

This makes stat-down moves MUCH more effective than buffing yourself.

Fake Tears, Screech, heck, even Sand Attack (since most of his moves are inaccurate anyway) will apply for the entire fight if you put it on before Charizard puts up his shield.

My Personal Headcannon/Theories on Paradox Pokemon,3,znzjwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znzjwa/my_personal_headcannontheories_on_paradox_pokemon/,7,1671256758.0,"I had these small ideas in my brain that I wanted to get out there since I saw the Paradox Pokemons. I really love the concept of the Past/Future Pokemon, even if I don't like a few of their designs (mostly the future ones since I feel there is some missed potential in the designs.) But I'm kind of a storyteller by heart, so I thought of cool backstory/lore for them that I wanted to put out there. If the discussion of Paradox Pokemon is a spoiler, I'll try to avoid specific examples. 

1. The Past Pokemon cannot evolve since, in prehistoric times, evolution was not needed since Pokemon would be born at their peak to hunt but only developed evolution once the pokemon equivalent of the Meteor Crash/Ice Age caused Pokemon to be forced to adapt (or evolve, pun intended) to the harsh environment, rather than who can hunt and eat each other the best. My reasoning is that some of the Past Paradox Pokemon are based on first-evolution pokemon, which seems weird, and that they can't evolve, which could imply that they can't. 
2. The Future Pokemon were created when either the Pokemon species began to slowly die out or as a way to continue Pokemon battling but without using real Pokemon to fight with. My theory is that since some of the entries speculate them being cyborgs, they could be purpose-built for survival, and their existence is slightly odd considering the many living machine/object Pokemon already naturally existing now, so they must have been built for a big reason, especially if there are so many that exist. 
3. An alternate theory for the future Pokemon is that they were initially built to replace Pokemon for whatever reason, but they went rogue and began a war with the humans/real Pokemon. This theory is based on the designs for the Future Paradox Pokemon resembling weapons and a lot of the entries describe their destructive power and perchance for violence, with descriptions of destroying or hurting others. 

I know that some of the things I talked about either aren't in the game or are in because of gameplay reasons, but I still wanted to get these thoughts out of my brain before I forget them. Feel free to ask questions or discuss things with me since I  love talking about lore things and could clarify things.",2022-12-17 07:59:18
My review of each arc of Ash's journey,11,znxhbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znxhbj/my_review_of_each_arc_of_ashs_journey/,3,1671249346.0," 

I did this last year when I finished Sun and Moon and since Journeys is over, I figured I'd share my thoughts on it. Most of these will stay the same or moved around from the last time. Long post incoming.

**1. Journeys**

I'm pretty sure that I will get some hate for ranking this as number 1, but I really do not care since I loved it all, even the seemingly ""filler"" episodes people complained about. I'm also probably not gonna get all of my thoughts for this series onto this post because I didnt binge it like the rest, so I honestly forgot a good many things.

I'll start with Ash and his goal for beating Leon. Honestly every one of his battles up to that point were good, even the ones he lost. I liked how he had his confidence shot down by Bea after their first battle, putting him on a small losing streak until he got his shit together through some deep training and what not (much like how Hop lost to Bede in Sw/Sh and had the same issue). After his initial loss against her, his 2nd and 3rd match had me on the edge of my seat, hoping he would win since I didnt know the outcome of it at the time I saw it (I had been watching the dub and went to the sub once my friend urged me to). Bea was a good rival for him in this arc. His other battles against Volkner, Iris, Marnie, and Raihan were also pretty great too, but the REAL battles were the Master's Eight Tournament against Steven, Cynthia, and of course Leon.

Steven's battle was like Pikachu's 3rd time defeating a Metagross and hes dubbed he Metagross slayer by fans haha. It was a solid 3v3 battle but the 6v6 Cynthia battle was crazier than that. The raw intensity of the 3 episode battle just had me wanting more each time. I love Cynthia a lot as a champion and for her character, but seeing her go toe to toe with Ash finally and the best boi coming out on top was satisfying to see. Now against Leon, that battle blew my expectations out of the water. I wasnt expecting him to allow Ash to use all 3 gimmicks against him (which is like a teacher allowing a student to use a cheat sheet during a test to be honest). Each defeat on both sides was crazy. I was really thinking Ash was going to lose the battle with how it went back and forth between the two. But that thought went away when the Pokemon Company SPOILED the ending on social media. Big rip for fans. The Pikachu vs Charizard fight had me sweating and nervous despite me knowing the outcome. The best part? Pikachu having a hard time standing up, everyone of Ash's friends (including May finally) watching with anticipation and concern on the TV screen, then Pikachu falling down and seeing all of Ash's past Pokemon in his dream like state before waking up to finish the battle. It was so wholesome and I cried like a baby. It was the best Pokemon episode ever aired.  
""But Ash only won with plot armor"" Thats nice, I dont care. He deserved that win, especially since hes not gonna be the main character anymore.

Ash's team was pretty solid this arc as well, even if 2 are dragon and 2 are fighting. Gengar's backstory was harsh and gave the same vibes that Charmander, Chimchar and Tepig had. Dragonite is a sweatheart, Dracovish and Sirfetchd were bros, and Lucario... well, I didnt like the fact Ash favored Riolu for a bit making Pikachu jealous and wanting to go back home. I'm glad they sorted that out in the same episode.

Now for Goh. Initially, I didnt have a lot of expectations for Goh. I sorta found him annoying but he grew on me over time. I liked how he started off as this kid who didnt have many friends and preferred to work alone on things but as time went on, Satoshi's personality sorta rubbed off on him and he became more open to friendship and working as a team, especially to find Mew. Him catching Suicune was a shocker, but it didnt really bother me unlike a lot of people. He was just thinking fast and threw his ball to save it from the poachers. Suicune didnt have to stay with him but chose to. 

The Project Mew episodes were alright. Some weren't my favorite but the ones with Gary and Horace (who I thought was a girl for some reason after a while) were definitely the better ones to me. The battle against Articuno, the battle royale in Sea Mauville, the Regieleki/Regidrago mission in the Crown Tundra which resulted in a vision of dynamax Regigigas showing up after. They were great. Their final mission to find Mew was, at first, intense until it was shown that Mew can transform into two Pokemon at once (Kyogre and Groudon) and it was just playing the entire time, even though it was being sort of a douche to the other Pokemon idly standing by. Overall, I enjoyed Goh's story as a support for Ash and him having his own goals partway through to find Mew again.

Now for Chloe... Okay, so, I know a lot of people dont like her. I'll agree that she was just a female companion that sat on the sidelines most of the time, but I enjoyed her character. Shes also adorable. I'm just bummed out that we never got any good climax with her Eevee. I was expecting it to be a Gigantamax one (since it cant evolve) while my friend thought it was gonna evolve into a new Pokemon. We were both wrong. Even after meeting all of those evolved forms as well as Lana and her Eevee, her arc ended with ""The possibilities are endless; do what you want"" which honestly was super anticlimactic. Not super bad, but was just underwhelming is all.

I liked the main arc of the earlier part of Journeys a bit more than the later ones, with it being the story of Sword and Shield and featuring Sonia during it. Ash and Goh were essentially the player (Victor/Gloria) and Hop as they both had Zacian and Zamazenta with Leon in the mix trying his best to stop Eternatus. I always love how they incorporate the game story into the anime. Its a shame we didnt get any content for Isle of Armor and barely any for Crown Tundra. As I mentioned, all we got for Crown Tundra was the Project Mew mission with the Regis.

The one side arc that really stood out to me was the Mohn episode. They did so well with that and when he got his memory of Lusamine, Gladion, and Lillie back, I was a crying mess. Nihilego being a shiny was cool as well.

I loved the cameos of past characters, the best one being Dawn since she showed up the most in the show. First she meets Chloe, Ash and Goh in the Darkrai and Cresselia episodes, later they have an issue with Dialga and Palkia and all four of them shrink down to babby sizes, then there was the Arceus special episodes, and then she shows up later for Ash's battle against Leon. Shes honestly my favorite companion now (Sorry Serena, May).

The other cameos during the Masters Eight Tournament were a nice touch too. Ritchie, Jimmy, Marina, the 3rd Johto guy that is friends with them, Drew, Harley, the other people that showed up in Hoenn, Paul, his brother, the Unova gang (minus Cameron, thank god), and the Kalos gang. Seeing them again was awesome after not seeing them for a hot minute.

I'll also remark that Team Rocket was pretty hysterical in this. The fact they stopped trying to get Pikachu at some point, started their own podcast and even cheering for Ash during the tournament made me love them more than I already did.

Art style and animation were peak in this series, especially in the Leon vs Ash battle. Absolute perfection.

Theme song for the Japanese sub is an absolute banger and so is the first English dub opening theme. The other two were meh.

A small gripe I have, thats not a big issue and really just my thought, was that Nessa didnt show up at all in the story. Would have loved to see her, Melony and even Klara too. Maybe even Honey (alongside Mustard for the Isle of Armor). Its weird we got to see both forms of Urshifu but not Kubfu.

All in all, with the character development, the animation, story, the cameos and of course the wins that Ash got in becoming World Champion, this series was a stellar experience. Its a 10/10 for me.

**2. Sun and Moon (Alola)**

This one I honestly had to start over a few times. I watched it to a certain point and got bored and watched something else. But once I binged season 20 and then season 21, I couldnt get enough. The art style is goofy, but its not hard to get past that at all. Its fluid with the animation and there are a lot of moments where they add great detail with comedy relief and intensity.

I loved how they added many of the parts from the games too: Lusamine getting controlled by Nihilego, Necrozma threatening the worlds and what not, and even Nebby showing up (which I didnt think would happen). All of the characters were amazing, with several emotional episodes: Stoutland dying (even if its implied), Mallow seeing her dead mother again through Tapu Fini's mist, Lillie getting Magearna to wake up and any time they mentioned Mohn, when they left Poipole back in its own world and when it said goodbye again at the end of the show, when Ash left Alola and a handful of others that dont come to mind right away.

The battles were amazing too, especially in the league. I wasnt expecting them to have an ACTUAL battle royale to see who goes on in the top 16. No other region has done that. Ash vs Guzma, then Gladion, then Kukui were absolute banger battles. I knew he won the league but I didnt know if he won against Kukui too. That last one was one of my favorite battles in the entire series. Pikachu vs Tapu Koko at the end just blew me away.

But, I will add that, when Ash battled Hau, he technically did lose because Rowlet fell asleep when it collided with Decidueye. In past regions if the Pokemon fell asleep (like with Charizard taking a nap or Snorlax being called out while it was asleep) they were considered forfeit. But regardless, Hau was nothing like his video game counterpart and that made me thrilled.

It was just a beautiful story altogether.

In Journeys, with Mohn's memory coming back and the few Alola episodes they slapped into it, this gets an increase for me. 10/10

**3. Diamond and Pearl (Sinnoh)**

I really enjoyed this one, even after years of bashing it, calling it dumb and too handholdy. It really wasnt. Ash and Paul were honestly the best rivals. Sure, Paul was a total douchebag, but him being like that drove Ash to beat him (even though he only beat him once). Infernape was his best Pokemon on his team here and frankly, he was arguably at his best here as well, with the way he battled and how Dawn helped him develop a new strategy.

Speaking of Dawn, she was one of my favorite party members for Ash. Ignoring her Piplup (because it fucking annoyed me halfway through), I really enjoyed her arc with contests. The way she was somewhat cocky to begin with because he mother was a contest star to then realizing after two losses that she needed to think things through thoroughly so she could win. I was glad she won the Wallace Cup. She definitely deserved it.

The league matches were on point as well. Ash vs Paul was one of my favorites to watch. Infernape digging underground then using Flare Blitz to get rid of Toxic Spikes was nuts. Not what I was expecting at all. But the one thing that annoyed me, and anyone else who watched it, was Tobias. Like, bruh. The dude comes into the league with a Darkrai that OHKOs any opponent. Ash was the only one to beat it and then he throws out a Latios. Tobias was the equivalent of a kid using an action replay to use all legendaries in the games.

The Team Galactic arc was pretty good too. One thing that made me shocked was how Hunter J just... died. She and her ship were at Lake Valor, trying to capture the three lake spirits for Cyrus, when their future sight blasted through the ship and it sunk into the water. You then see J's visor broken and sinking with it. I was like ""Did... Did she just die?"" Yes. Yes, she did.

The theme songs were absolute bangers too. Not Battle Dimension though. The other three were so much better.

After watching Journeys, and with Paul getting the character development of being able to SMILE and help Ash, I'm bumping this up. 9.5/10

**4.** **XY and XYZ (Kalos)**

This one was my favorite for a good while. It was also the first arc I watched after a long time of not watching the show, since I was convinced the new voices since Battle Frontier were still bad. Nah, they really aren't. The art style and animation were the most clean cut and crisp as well. The theme songs were absolute bangers, especially XYZ.

The story was amazing, with the last handful of episodes being intense as ever with Lysandre trying to literally destroy the world. Team Rocket has their best theme motto here and its as if the creators spent more on the art and animation of those three lovable goons than the actual show hahaha. I was iffy on Bonnie joining the group, since Max was honestly annoying, but shes a doll. She was the reverse of Brock, always trying to find a girl for Clemont to marry and him pulling her away, much like Misty did to Brock.

I loved the dynamic with Ash and Serena, even though Ash was clueless as ever, even at the end where its implied she kissed him before she left. She was amazing in her showcases too, and should have won against Aria.

The only \*real\* gripe I have with the series is how Ash got robbed in the league against Alain. He definitely should have won that battle, since hes arguably at his best in this entire arc with Greninja. 

After watching Journeys and rethinking Alola and Sinnoh, I had to bump this one down unfortunately. 9/10

**4. Advanced Series and Battle Frontier (Hoenn)**

Now, Hoenn is my favorite gen of all time. May having been my favorite of Ash's friends for a long time. Even made a Kingdom Hearts OC loosely based off of her. But with the show, while I did love the banger theme songs of the 4 seasons, the story was just... kinda boring for the most part.

Ash's team was pretty solid but the shining Swellow and Pikachu combo he did against Tate and Liza was just... what? I know its anime logic but it made zero sense. May's contest arc showed how matured she had gotten, especially since she was cocky after 2 wins. Drew was a good rival for her as well, but Harley? FUCK Harley. That dude annoyed the fuck outta me so much, even though in the Battle Frontier one scene had me rolling when he was running flamboyantly to May to greet her.   
""MAY, MY LITTLE GINGERBREAD COOKIE, HOW ARE YOU HUN??""

Max was... whats the word... a pest. He was just that annoying little brother that had to play with the older sibling because their parents told them he could. Like, Idk why they added him in there. He didnt do anything for the series at all, save for like a few episodes where May and Max had a sibling moment. And his new voice actor was just abysmal, even worse than the original.

The Team Aqua and Magma arc was solid, following the story the same as the games did.

Theme songs were my favorites for a while

The Battle Frontier was actually stellar. My favorite was Anabel, who I never knew had a crush on Ash the few days they spent together. I wish they delved into that more or she could have shown up in Sun and Moon again (since she was in the games). And anyone who says Ash sucks at this point is just, well, wrong. He beat them all, even Brandon which Paul couldnt do in Diamond and Pearl. He was offered a position as a brain but he declined.

It was a fun series to go through. 7.8/10

**5. Johto Journeys/League Champion and Master Quest (Johto)**

This one was... I dont know, it wasnt bad but it wasnt really all that great. A lot of people love gen 2, which is great, but I dont really like it much.

The theme songs were total bangers.

The art style and animation was the same as Kanto, which was fine for the time it was made but looking back at it, its not great. The story wasnt that great either, with the only real arcs to happen were with Team Rocket when they tried to capture Lugia and Red Gyarados.

Other than that, Ash still wasnt bright, Brock carried the team, Misty was just as dumb. A lot of the time she was like ""Oh you're battling a water type? Ash, let me battle it. I'll use my water type against it to win cause theyre my specialty!""??????? Misty thats not how it works.

Tbh I liked it for nostalgia mostly. I did like how Charizard and Ash grew to like and respect each other more, but thats mostly it.

It was okay. 5/10

**6. Indigo League and Orange Islands (Kanto)**

This one was arguably Ash's worst seasons, with the Orange Islands making up for what happened in the Indigo League.

This is when Ash started his journey. He was NOT a good trainer. He wins a few battles and thinks hes the best, but then a dude who's won 98 battles in a row comes along, beats him, and Ash thinks he cheated.

He also won half of his badges out of pity/luck:  
\- Boulder Badge was a technicality with the water sprinklers making Onix wet so Thunderbolt would be effective.  
\- Cascade Badge he saved the gym from Team Rocket (and because Misty's sisters knew if he used Pikachu against Misty he would win).  
\- Rainbow Badge he saved Erika's Gloom from a fire.  
\- Marsh Badge Haunter made Sabrina laugh, which made her unable to battle.

He only genuinely beat Surge, Koga and Blaine. Didnt even fight Giovanni but he did fight his Pokemon through Team Rocket.

Charmeleon didnt listen to him, thanks to Ash wanting him to lose on purpose to a Paras, which he didnt like. Thats when it lost respect for Ash. But in the Orange Islands, when it was a Charizard, it started respecting him more after it nearly died from being frozen and Ash took care of him.

Theme songs were bangers too, but not my favorites.

I'll give Ash something tho. For his first league, he was in the top 16. Thats pretty good for a 10 year first starting out.

I'd really only watch these two series again for nostalgia. 6/10

**7. Black and White (Unova)**

Unlike their video game counterpart, this series was just bad. It had a few good things but for the most part, it was awful.

Ash was definitely at his worst here. Sure, he was bad in Kanto since he first started but in this he should have known better from the past 4 regions he was at. But the show made it seem like he knew nothing anymore, even if the region literally only had Unova Pokemon.

Iris and Cilan werent terrible friends for him, but they did get annoying as ever with their constant ""You're such a kid"" and ""This adds a new flavor"" every episode.

Trip was a shitty rival, sort of like a cheap Paul copy. Alder was a moron.

What really pissed me off was how Ash lost in the league. He meets this no named idiot Cameron who thinks 7 badges gets him in. They tell him its 8 and he scrambles to get the last one. They meet at a league and he doesnt know they have to sign up until Ash mentions it. And then when they battle in the quarter finals (I think), the dude brings 5 Pokemon and STILL beats Ash. Total BS. I expected Ash to lose, but I was hoping he'd battle the Eevee trainer they had met earlier in the series.

Bianca was a great, but a clumsy, character. The way she always wanted to ""feel"" Sawk's muscles after it used Bulk Up made me lol each time. The Team Rocket and Team Plasma arcs were pretty great but as for story, those are it.

The theme songs... while catchy after a while, weren't really super great. Tbh I liked the Reshiram and Zekrom full version of the season 15 theme song a lot more.

I tolerated this series honestly. 3/10

I know its a long post but thats what I think of each series. Its been a long ride with Ash. Hes the very best now. I only hope the send off episodes are good and I hope the next protagonist for Scarlet and Violet is just as good.",2022-12-17 05:55:46

Did you ever do something stupid the first time you played Pokémon?,6,znze2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znze2o/did_you_ever_do_something_stupid_the_first_time/,33,1671256152.0," 

When we all played Pokémon for the first time we all did something stupid or believed something stupid. weather it was a type match up or a way of playing what is your dumb thing that you did when you first played Pokémon?

I'll go first:

When I played Pokémon for the first time it was playing Pokémon sword and I tried to catch one of those High lvl Pokémon in the wild area. I think it was a xatu and it was lvl 26 and I didn't even have my first gym badge yet and I didn't have any game-ending moves (teleport, etc) and I didn't know what poke dolls were so I sat there and went back multiple times. I gave up after about an hour and then the next day I ran into a lvl 24 diggersby and didn't learn from the other day and tried to catch it for about 20 minutes and after that decided to faint all my Pokémon and just go to the gyms.

TLDR: I tried to catch a high lvl Pokémon in the wild area and gave up after an hour",2022-12-17 07:49:12

Starting yesterday I noticed that I couldn’t get a shiny azuril in a mass outbreak, I had knocked out 60 and was using a level 2 encounter like I always do for outbreaks, 30 mins passed and no shiny. I thought this was odd so I made a level 3 encounter + sparkling power sandwich. Another 30 minutes passed, no shiny. So I put it down to the game being stubborn. I flew to the desert to isolated encounter hunt an othworm. Threw on a level 3 steel sandwich and rode around for 30 minutes with no shiny. I then reset my game and threw on another level 3 sandwich and got 6 in the space of 30 minutes. 

Today I was hunting Manky. I managed to get two using a level 2 sandwich and doing an isolated encounter hunt, but then I stopped seeing shinys. So I threw on a level 3…Still no shinys. Reset the game again and still the same thing. Decided to try and go to the top of the map to isolated hunt a heracross which I’ve done before with good success. 30 mins no shiny.

I’m not sure what’s going on here but it seems like the game is either not spawning shinys, or they’re spawning in their non-shiny colours.

Arceus then chose a planet that was fit, and created Kyogre to create and rule the sea, Groudon to create and rule the land, and Rayquaza to create and rule the sky. Arceus created Solgaleo who created day, and Lunala, who created night.

You also have to probably count for the movies, which also take up the canonical canonical time as well.

But then you also have the Christmas specials as well, which have Pokemon around Generation 2-3 I think, meaning that if we do count them, its likely that the Anime started in the latter half of the year.

I know its about marketing and stuff, but I think its interesting to think of.

How possible do you think it is for it to be likely true?

As i don't have fully access of SV this is not something i can fully fact check myself, so if this is completely wrong i apologize. 

First off, that would be such an interesting twist to an already amazing and interesting story. Second, it personally makes me feel way better about Violet's paradox forms.. which are all named Iron+something and seem to all be robots (they are cool! but bit off putting for the posible implications of the world?) They seem more like a fantasy of someone obsessed with the idea of future that the actual future.

Second, and the reason I'm making this post (which is totally shooting in the dark and will likely be totally wrong) is that it got me thinking about the overall mystery behind the terastallization. I'm not a theory person, so all i truly had thought was ""wait, if it's a creation machine and not related to time, would it be like a wish machine?"" and i got excited thinking it could be related to Jirachi! We haven't got (as far i can recall) anything relating to Jirachi in the later years. And i adore what i call ""tiny"" mythicals (Mew(?), Jirachi, Celebi, Victini, and my beloved but forgotten Shaymin) 

I thought about it more, and knowing Kalos is probably going to be connected to the DLC i don't think Jirachi is going to be involved (or Celebi for that matter, which would also be cool since time travel and all) and it's that is more likely something to do with Diancie, or some new pokemon or lore that's not related to anything we have seen before.

5 questions about the new anime and five other things I want out of it,0,znxijp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znxijp/5_questions_about_the_new_anime_and_five_other/,7,1671249468.0,"Questions 

1. Will Pikachu stay the mascot implying one of the two new kids would get one and if so, unless they are doing a Boruto thing and Riko/Liko is Ash's kid who gets his, will it evolve into Raichu or will they somehow have to also justify this one not evolving either (if they need another reason, my money's on some weird area-zero-related timey-wimey that's also why, if these two aren't just the protags for Paldea, they won't age either)

2. If Riko/Liko is from Kanto but is not Ash's kid how are they going to not make her story feel like a retread of Ash's while still keeping to the general Pokemon formula?

3. Will there ever be any reason for this new anime to go to Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos or Galar (as remakes wouldn't justify it unless you want these protagonists defeating the same villain teams Ash did again again)?

4. Will it be as goofy as people are fearing or will it actually be capable of getting XY hardcore (as if I wrote a Pokemon anime, no matter who led it, I'd aim for the happy medium, something like the same tone as Steven Universe or The Owl House, y'know, capable of getting goofy and kinda knows how goofy it is when it does but also capable of enough depth and emotionality that the fun feels like a breath of fresh air from whenever an episode kinda puts a character through the wringer)

5. Is the dub just going to be Netflix-only and if so what happens when streaming inevitably goes bust?

5 other things I want

1. actual lgbt representation (it wouldn't have to be in the kids if you think that's inappropriate as I think the ScVi games actually have a subtextually-hinted-at gay couple between one of the gym leaders and elite four) as I mean come on, it's 2022

2. crossdressing episodes (maybe if Roy is going to be the english name of the new male protag, maybe his ""girl name"" like Ash had Ashley could be something like Roia) but going both ways and having at least one where the female protag has to pull a Mulan to do some boys-only thing alongside him (so it'd read less like ""ha ha guy in dress funny"" but still keep up the tradition from Ash)

3. the first movie with these guys to be actually released in theaters just like iirc the first Pokemon movie ever was (with maybe some more songs by artists we know are Pokemon fans like Ed Sheeran or Post Malone on the soundtrack though the dream would be one of these guys actually doing one of the English anime theme tunes)

4. this marking a return to villains you can actually take seriously (as you can't just have whoever's this era's Jessie and James and a bunch of Skull/Yell/Star-esque teams forever especially as ScVi's the closest a generation has had to no true villain)

And above all 
5. another 25-year journey for them so another new generation can have the anime be their childhoods and we can be old enough to track and fan-[gender] about the entire journey on social media as the internet as we know it today didn't exist when the original anime premiered

Remember, this may have technically been your childhood coming to an end but you're also no longer a child anymore, refrain from flaming and let this be someone else's childhood",2022-12-17 05:57:48

I want SKILL and SUBSTANCE in my opponents. If I lose, I wanna know I lost because I suck and not because some 12 year old used a Palafin or Maushold with King's Rock. 

""Why don't you just use Showdown?"", you ask, seeing as its 100% better in almost every way from battling opponents online in the game. 

Because, I wanna see my boys in the game and with the proper graphics, that's why. 

So anyways, I'm proposing those of us who want competitive battling (smogon rulesets and bans in place) in either 6v6 or doubles use this **LINK CODE: 5306-0200**

If you use this link code, please stick to and honor the current Smogon metagame, rules, clauses, and bans. They're crafted by the Pokémon community to foster battles that emphasize skill over advantage and chance. Otherwise you might as well just stick to the general Link Battles or go do Ranked.

The number is a good one I feel. It's easy to remember. It spells out ""Smogon"" using numbers (a bit of a stretch I know, but flip the numbers on their side. I guess it really says ""Smogonoo"" but you need 8 digits). 

Lemme know if all y'all are down for this, and if so, I'll be ready to battle whomever will take me up on this proposal!

I remember the excitement of asking my parents for a pack of cards if we went to the corner store, or 7-11; and the smell of freshly opened card packs wafting up as I tore away the plastic haphazardly to see if I'd pulled any of my favorite monsters. 

I remember getting Yellow and being absolutely obsessed, battling and trading over classic link cable with my little brother to get all the mons I was missing. I remember teachers chatting idly about how sick they were of the craze, taking away cards and gameboys until the end of the school day. Boys and girls both flaunted binders of cards, sometimes just stacks of them held together with rubber bands. Few of us knew how to actually play. 

I remember my father sitting down with me to learn the card game; I started with the magmar starter deck. There was a 2 player mat, we sat at the kitchen table and it was such a complex game for me but I tried to hard to learn. I remember learning to play marbles, getting that absolutely humungous poke'mon marble shooter, and being proud of my poke'mon marble collection. I remember naming a yellow tang fish I'd gotten Pikachu.

I had all the VHS tapes, even the ones that came in those special starter themed carrying cases. I remember the Ranma 1/2 and Kimba commercials at the end of the VHS tapes, stopping them, rewinding them, and then going onto the next episodes on repeat. I went through TWO poke'mon the first movie VHS tapes, and would set up my poke'mon action figures to sit and watch the movie with me. I remember getting my moving electronic pikachu plush with its light up cheeks and my brother had the mew one. 

I remember playing silver, and crystal. Seeing the second movie in theatres. Emerald was the first game I ever beat in a single night- one sitting, from 8PM to 6:30AM. I'd never done that before, with any game. I remember waking up early to go to my local gamestop to pick up pokemon diamond and pearl, getting the most awful, TERRIBLE DS stylus pens ever produced and being ecstatic over them. 

I remember being in my first year of college and finding my old copy of fire red, and restarting. Going through my kanto journey once again between classes- and often, instead of doing homework or studying. 

I'm nearing 30 now. Poke'mon has been with me for as long as I can remember. I still remember watching ash shout to that flock of Spearow that he was going to be the greatest poke'mon master of all time, and Pikachu jumping in to save him. 

Next month, Ash will be moving on, and so will Pikachu. Over thanksgiving, I bought, beat, and 100% completed poke'mon scarlet. So many things about my life, and the franchise, have changed; the world of 2022 is so much different. Being able to look up any question on poke'mon I have would have amazed me at 4 or 5 years old. 

Next month, when Ash and Pikachu say their goodbyes, I'll say goodbye back to them. We've all gotten older, but I'm not letting go of the great times Poke'mon has brought me. Through all its forms of media, I'm legitimately grateful for the creative minds behind this series, and to Ash and Pikachu for being great role models for friendship. Goodbye, Ash and Pikachu.

I Have been a pokemon fan since the very beginning. In my mind, it doesnt seem like that long ago I watched Ash take his first steps on his journey.

Pokemon has had a huge effect on my life. In the best ways. Ive played the games. Ive read the manga. Ive followed the TV series, and as a veteran fan, I have to say, its almost surreal that Ash's journey has finally come to an end. 

I know alot of people think its a good thing. That he waa an annoying main character and he wasnt a good trainer. But, to that end, I say he didnt have to be. To me, he was the best, instead of focusing on trying to the most powerful, he put his pokemons freedom above his own dreams.

He was willing to put his own dreams, even his life in some cases, on the line for the sake of his love of pokemon. And yes, he was in no way perfect. But im kind of glad he wasnt. A unique approach to his pokemon training, a genuin love for his pokemon, he truly was a great trainer.

That being said, I didnt think this would hit me as hars as it did. But i never thought Id live to see the day Ash's journey came to an end. And all that being said, as hars as it is, I am glad we are getting a fresh start for a new generation of pokemon fans.

Will GameFreak ever Embrace their Older Fanbase?,0,znwqqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znwqqx/will_gamefreak_ever_embrace_their_older_fanbase/,20,1671246784.0,"Pokémon, it’s an amazing game, it’s become a global phenomenon for a reason, because of this though it seems that GameFreak is hesitant to make any drastic changes to the overall formula, which is good! 

But also frustrating, look at the gimmicks that have been abandoned over the years that were genuinely fun, Mega Evolutions were great, Alpha Pokémon were cool as shit, eh on the Z-Moves, Dynamax and Gigantimax added a lot to competitive strategy, and now we have Terastrilization. 

From there we can talk about plot, we went from having teams of adults hell bent on drastically altering the world as we know it, running intricate crime syndicates, and just being generally bad people to, *checks notes* Rowdy children, and aggressive punks? 

It fits the overall theme of Pokémon as it’s been established more in the games, but if we look at the anime and the manga Pokemon can explore deeper topics and ideas surrounding what on the surface appears to be Animal Fight Club.

Which isn’t a problem really if we look at Pokémon Black and White, Pokémon X and Y, and Pokémon Sun and Moon, all of which heavily focus on what it means to be a trainer and a companion to your Pokémon, even with the child/teen protagonist idea that Pokémon has stuck with over the years. 

Pokémon has aged well, and it will always be a game that seeks to draw in new generations of kids to enjoy the same things we did growing up. That being said though, a lot of their community has aged up, and that can be seen when we look at the most popular streamers and dedicated fans appearing to be anywhere from 17-28, and looking to Nuzlocking to increase the overall difficulty of the game because GameFreak is afraid of alienating their younger audience by implementing increased difficulty. 

But that brings us to my ultimate question, 

Do you think we’ll see a point where the Protagonist of a mainline game is an adult? And how do we imagine that affecting the plot? How would you like to see this implemented, if at all? 

With Scarlet and Violet introducing the Academies, we see that a lot of new trainers are older, even going so far as to see a geriatric student enrolled in the school. Not only that, but it seems that we’re finally seeing the official retirement of the eternal 10 year old trope codifier that is Ash Ketchum. 

I’d like to think that perhaps GameFreak is priming the community for a change to the overall formula, and maybe open up new doors to explore different ideas and themes than we’ve seen in the past. 

Does anyone else have any thoughts on this?",2022-12-17 05:13:04

Can I get some verification on the differences and my thought process is correct here.

1. I need to play Black/White before Black/White 2 as it's a true sequel in terms of story. 
2. I can play White, then Black 2. Or Black then White 2, without hindering my experience.

However after almost 25 years of our boy from Pallet Town trying, I never felt like he became any closer to becoming a Pokemon Master.

In order to be a Pokemon Master, in my opinion, Ash would need to at minimum 

A-Catch Every Pokemom
and 
B-Become Champion

Pokemon Let's Go of all things seemed like it had the best requirements. Catch every pokemon, become champion, and beat the competively viable Master Trainers. That's really a Pokemon Master to me.

If you wanna go ooooverboooard...
At maximum(and let me emphasize MAXIMUM) he needs to
A-Catch Every Pokemon, including alternate forms and possibly size/shiny variants
B-Participate and Win Contests
C-Spend time as a Pokemon Ranger
D-Build a beautiful secret base and Underground Base
E-Become champion and defend it. at least in 1 region but possibly all of them
F-Retire as a gym leader
G-Train Every Pokemon to its maximum Potential
H-If youre feeling REEEALLY SPICY, EV train all of them to perfection
I-Fight Red

For my minimum requirements, Ash is a champion. But I want him to catch every pokemon before the show ends. He's got 11 episodes left😂

\- Reunited with old Pokemon (pretty much confirmed but I hope they do each reunion justice)  
\- Maybe some old recurring character cameos (like Todd, Ritchie, or Duplica)  
\- Ash buys Misty a new bike  
\- Reunite (or closure) with Serena--but PERSONALLY would be down for Ash x Misty romance too  
\- Team Rocket finally quit + lead honest lives..?

Pokemon Conquest: Japanese -> English Personal Pronouns?,2,znsyoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znsyoo/pokemon_conquest_japanese_english_personal/,3,1671235090.0,"Hello,

Today, I finished a replay of the main story of Pokemon Conquest for the DS. Very good game, if you're unfamiliar!

Throughout the game the main antagonist, Nobunaga (a fictional parallel of the historical Oda Nobunaga), uses his own name to reflect himself in speech. An example, albeit paraphrased, would be formatted as ""Nobunaga will be waiting for you at Dragnor Castle."" instead of ""I will be waiting for you at Dragnor Castle.""

For anyone who may have relevant input, is this a quirk of Japanese speech that doesn't translate well to English? This form of speech comes off as rather odd in English, where I'm lead to believe that it's a figure of speech present in Japanese with no English parallel.

Why is there no battle tower.

I'm not sure about you all, but fighting Miraidon/Koraidon and Minimize Drifblim is really NOT fun when you just want a casual battle

I don't want to JUST fight the team star bosses all the time, I mean, granted they are the best part because they're unique, can be chosen, and have thier original battle themes, but eventually that will get on my nerves if I do it too much.

YOU CAN'T EVEN REFIGHT THE ELITE FOUR! I want whoever made that idea to be fired because why the hell would you remove such a core mechanic in every game before this but suddenly remove it in the game that needs it most??

No legendarys, mythics, ultra beasts
Only 6 Pokémon on the team
Pokémon can/can't be zombiefied (I say it this way to see who does what, also that way yall have freedom to have fun with it). That way, not everyone picks tropius and every steel type in the book.




My Team

Blastoise
Favorite pokemon of all time
Fresh water, weaponized water, water transportation, shell can protect it from pretty much all zed damage imo


Gengar
Ghost pokemon that can't even be touched
Can scavenge easy as all get out
Great scout
Great damage and defense 


Lucario
Its aura reading would be priceless for humans encountered as well, as picking up on ppl nearby or far.
Great fighter, could be a training partner.
Also, part steel, so maybe not able to zombify
Amazing damage


Tyranitar
Boss of a pokemon on both stats
Def would not zombify
Can dig
Could take on a swarm by himself.
Just an overall beast a Pokémon 


Salamance
Fire access 
Flying
Amazing move set
Super fast transportation
It's my favorite dragon


Jolteon
My favorite electric Pokémon 
Would use to power stuff (in fantasy wouldn't take all his power or need continued use)
Speedy
Spikey body 
Also, like a dog, so him and Lucario could always be out walking with me at all times.



Other optionals I debated

Metagross
Scyther/Scizor
Alkazam
Skarmory
Rotom
Talonflame
Pinsir
Aggron
Steelix
Corviknight
Gyrados

Basically Sylveon gets this ability called pixilate, which turns I think every normal into fairy type, which makes any move get a STAB bonus. So what is a powerful move that can be turned into a STAB boosted Charizard Killer? Hyper beam. I saw with my own eyes a Charizard go from full health, to like the red, allowing for the win in a matter of seconds.

So when the raid begins, if you do decide to use Sylveon, set up with either calm mind or fake tears. It really depends on what your other teammates are doing tho. Ok next when your setup is complete just hyper beam. It does so much damage even when the shield is up too. Just remember to set up a bit, I think the players I played with used calm mind, cos I was using fake tears but anwyays. 

Hope you can destroy all Charizards now. Also note, being a support player in raids is actually really integral to winning raids, so it doesn't hurt to use your cheers.",2022-12-17 00:34:04

Geeta's team is supposed to represent each different location we have visited in Paldea:

- Gogoat represents the vast grassy fields.
- Espathra represents the desserts.
- Avalugg represents the snowy mountains at the north of the map.
- Veluza represents the rivers, seas and lakes of Paldea.
- Kingambit represents the spiky mountains at the north west of the region.
- Glimmora can represent the caves, but also, and why it's her last Pokémon, an unexplored zone, Area Zero.

Maybe it's a coincidence but it makes sense, due to Nemona being the real champion, that gamefreak purpose was represent the richness and the beauty of the Paldea region through Geeta's team.",2022-12-17 00:32:11

About the new characters (Theory),5,znqyo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znqyo1/about_the_new_characters_theory/,5,1671229642.0,"So, from what I've seen, people are connecting the new characters for the Pokemon Animated Series in Paldea, Riko is the daughter of Ash and Serena, while Roy is the son of Goh. While this is plausible, I personally don't see this. So, I decided to do a personal twist on who these characters ""parents"" might be. Now there's supposed info about these characters which is what I'm basing this on. [Here's the info.](https://i.redd.it/hvghu95paa6a1.jpg) There are two ideas I made:

Idea 1 (Possible Parents and the unlikely path):

So, from what we know Riko is from Kanto and loves Pokemon, has an easygoing attitude but she **doesn't talk about her family.** That alone could be a hint that her father is Ash to some extent. Not to mention, the pin in her hair is the same logo from Ash's hat in Kanto. However, my only problem with this connection is the hair color. Riko has raven black hair and blue. Ash has black hair, while Serena is blonde. Everyone seems to be connecting Serena to Riko because of her kissing Ash towards the end of the Pokemon X and Y series, but neither Ash or Serena have blue hair. So, this is what I came up with for Riko's ""possible mother.""

It's not Serena, although she has blue eyes, but not blue hair. Dawn is a qualifier since she has both blue eyes and blue hair, but her hair isn't a vibrant blue. I thought it might be Lana because her hair color is pretty close to the blue in Riko's hair and this is where it gets crazy; Riko inherited a mixture of Ash and Lana's hair colors, Ash's eyes, but Lana's eye color.

Now onto Roy (Roi):

It says he's a Paldean native that wants to become the greatest chef in the world (Sanji would like to have a word with you about that) so he can take over his family business lead by his father. Although a caring person, he doesn't like the outdoors. Prior to all of this, I made the theory that he was the son of Kiawe, the Fire type Gym Leader from Alola because the hair is very similar and his mother was Iris because of eye color and skin tone, but with this info that's been shot down. I then thought he might be related to Nemona, but she has an unnamed sister not a brother.

&#x200B;

Idea 2 (The more logical path):

Before any of this ""info"" was revealed, I wanted to ignore the ""Riko is Ash and Serena's kid"" path since it doesn't fit the character in my opinion and took a different route; Riko, a trainer from Kanto that as inspired by Ash which is why she has the hairpin as a way to achieve her goal. But with the given info, here's what I came up with: Riko **is** the daughter of Ash, but she wants to become popular for her own reasons and not because her father is a World Champion. Think about that for a second, you want to make a name for yourself and your mother / father is a huge name, that puts some . 

As for Roy, he's just a new character. The anime brings in characters that aren't in the video games like the aforementioned Goh, Tobias (Mr. ""I have both Darkrai and Latias""), and so forth. There's no real character he can be connected to that's from Paldea aside from Ryme and Ms. Tyme, but even then that's stretching it.

Antagonists in Pokémon - replacing Jesse and James,1,znq52g,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znq52g/antagonists_in_pokémon_replacing_jesse_and_james/,5,1671227508.0,"In the original Pokemon games, you had your rival on one side, and a global organization that stole Pokémon and felt like a genuine threat to your character at every meeting, right up until you face Giovanni for the last time on your final gym badge and wipe them out for good. With every new generation, though, it feels like the stakes have been lowered with the ""big bad"" your facing off against. 

I get that Pokemon is meant to be a kids game, so by no means do I expect them to come out of left field with a character as unhinged as I remember Ghetsus being in Black and White, but it makes me wonder who could possibly fill the roll of our favorite chaotic trio in a series that no longer seems to have anyone to fill that space? Team Rocket in the show was never overtly threatening, however their ultimate goal was to steal Pikachu because that's what Team Rocket did. Given that Team Star in the new region is full of kids who left school over being bullied, it doesn't seem as though they'd be able to fill that slot, and Pokemon without a Team Rocket shenanagin plot just feels... Empty?

So knowing what we do now, that Jesse and James are fully leaving the show, and Team Rocket (or any criminal organization for that matter) hasn't had a real presence beyond them in the anime for the past few years, who do you think would make a good replacement? Do you think we'll see more of this regions rival to spur the new antagonists onward, or will it be an uptick in ""encounter a problem, find a solution"" plots that don't need third party interference to set the wheels in motion?

But something I've seen a lot on this subreddit is that whenever someone, who's not a child, shares a thought on how the show should evolve, they get bombarded with comments like ""It's a show for kids"" or ""The show is made for kids so it just wouldn't work"". And they are right, so here is what I suggest and what A LOT of people have suggested.

Make a new show. Something that's made specifically for teens and above. It can run side-by-side with the main Pokémon anime. It can be more mature (not saying R-rated, although that sounds cool), explore darker themes, and show us a grittier world of Pokémon through the eyes of an older protagonist. Shows like Ben 10 Alien Force (still a kids show) had darker themes and was arguably better than its predecessor. Naruto is extremely popular and was enjoyed by everyone, and it had no problem being gritty when it had to. Dragon Ball Z had an older protagonist with high stakes every arc and kids, teens, adults all loved the blood and the fights (not saying make Pokémon bloody). Pokémon could very much use a show with high stakes, consequences, well-written connected story-lines and character development, grit, and an overall feeling of maturity.

Some of you may hate this idea, but it seems worth exploring. A show that's geared towards an older audience may actually catch the attention of a lot of people who have stopped watching the show, or people who never touched the show because ""It's a show for kids"".

Seeing as how Ash's era is coming to an end soon, it seems like a great opportunity for The Pokémon Company to take a risk with this type of show, I'd at least give it a chance.

I'm going to make a poll to see if most people really do hate this idea, in which case I'm probably going to stop with my ideas on how the show should move forward.

I just wanted to share my thoughts on one of my favorite Pokémon: Comfey!

First of all, Comfey has an absolutely adorable design, with its little green body and fluffy white petals. But it's not just a cute face - Comfey is also a formidable opponent in battle. Its Fairy-type moves are super effective against Dragon-type Pokémon, making it a valuable asset on any team.

But what really sets Comfey apart, in my opinion, is its unique ability, Triage. This ability allows Comfey's healing moves to have a higher priority in battle, meaning it can heal its teammates before the opponent has a chance to attack. This makes Comfey a great support Pokémon and can really turn the tide of battle in your favor.

Overall, I think Comfey is a underrated and underappreciated Pokémon that deserves more recognition. If you haven't given it a chance yet, I highly recommend giving Comfey a try on your team!

Then, im basically saiyng that some pokemon in Paldea were stolen from regions, unknow until now, based in these countries previously mentione. The dex too, allude this with some pokemon found in the lands of the region.

The most notable pokemon comming from outside are  the starters.  Sprigatito, alltought all the Puss In Boots references in his design, comes from Philippines and it becomes clear thanks the pañuelo and yo-yo that he uses when  Floragato. Furthermore, Meowscarada seems use a mannila, a typical wear used in flamenco, and his mask comes from the Masskara Festival.

Follow this line, Fuecoco  obviously would have been stolen from México. Along its evolution line became possible infamous references.  Crocalor, has an ""sombrero"" and the stooped way he walks makes his back look like and ponch,  your final form even has an frontal design inspired in mexican's skulls for Dia De Los Muertos. Despite, the egg in the top of his head when is Crocalor and the little bird floating at  Skeledirge  snourt maybe comes from folklore Cuca. (If anyone has a better sugestion please share)

Lastly, but the one I like the most, Quaxly. Any brazillian, ""só de bater o olho"", can notice the obvious Carnaval's references in his second evolution,  Quaxwell. The way that place his hands is the typical guise of any sambista dancing at the sambódromo. In Quaquaval this become more evident, not only because his distinguishable swing, yet the feathers who has behind it's too much like the gaudy dance wears. Don't saying about the dex entries alluding abou his foreign origins

Adding some more proofs.

Pawmi are chinchilas, natural from Bolivia, Peru, Chile e Argentina.

Maschiff maybe comes from Brazillians Filas. Evidents by dark type.

Squawkabilly literally are Loro Josés that comes in the colors of brazillian flag.

If i found more examples i will add.

Hot take: I actually like Flint’s D/P/BD/SP team,3,znn8x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znn8x8/hot_take_i_actually_like_flints_dpbdsp_team/,6,1671219980.0,"Hear me out. Do I think it’s dumb that GameFreak put a Fire-type specialist in a game with only two Fire types in its Pokédex? Yes, absolutely. However, I think that given the limitations, the team that the devs gave him is actually pretty clever.

Rapidash and Infernape are obvious. Drifblim works well since it’s based on a hot-air balloon, and the hot air used to lift a “hot-air balloon” is created by a hot flame lit below the balloon. Steelix is especially clever given Flint’s name, since flint and steel was used as a way to set fires for centuries before matches and lighters were invented. The only team member that doesn’t really make sense is Lopunny, but at least they gave it Fire-type moves to fit Flint’s specialty.

Also, in general, I actually like it when type specialists are given Pokémon that don’t fit their type specialty, but are still reasonable given the trainer’s theme. I think of Clair and Lance using Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Charizard despite being Dragon specialists, Agatha using Golbat and Arbok despite being a Ghost specialist, and Raihan using Gigalith and Sandaconda despite being a Dragon specialist. Am I insane in this regard?",2022-12-16 21:46:20

what OTHER things i wish to see for future open world game.,2,znn2m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znn2m0/what_other_things_i_wish_to_see_for_future_open/,0,1671219519.0,"Why other things specifically? Because if is just the normal things, i would have probably say the same things everyone want first ""better graphics"" ""nat dex"" ""more polish"" ""voice acting""...but what about things i personally would like that really are a bit more of personal spices i would add in my dream pokemon open world game.

1) Atmospheric sounds, over normal BGM.

Maybe atleast make it an option, but i love to see gamefreak push the sound design, and let us hear the sounds of nature to what you would think you'd hear in a fantasy world, BGM could be like in botw and how it really is more of compliment to the sounds of natures in the world of hyrule.

2)G max size pokemon...that are their actual size in the open world.

something they kinda get explored in scarlet and violet, but is only stuck to titan pokemon which cool...but, would it be nice if the titan pokemon you see are actually just their actual normal size, these aren't special variant who ate a magic fruit or something, these are giant collosi pokemon, that are just as natural to the region as the level 5 rat by your house.

And as you explore the open world, you can see a building size monkey pokemon casually roaming the plains as like a regular pokemon would.

Imagine combining with the first wish as you can now hear, gianr foot steps and earthquake if one were close by.

3) I actually like to just catch ANY pokemon i want without any cap of any kind 

As in, if i want, i can go straight to a level 50 haxorus with nothing but a level 5 fire boy and catch it right there, the only cap is that you only have a level 5 boy and a bunch of pokeballs, which honestly if you beat the actual odds of doing that, you kinda deserve one really.

Maybe only real cap is the usual trade pokemon wont obey...but other than that as long as is your name, you can use it.

4) I actually like to have access to all my HM moves.

Why? Because i want to promote maniac play styles if you have the sheer will to do it.

Together with part 3, is because i like to invoke that kind  chaos speed runs of botw in that you run can to ganon with nothing but your underwear, 3 hearts and a stick, i just like to enable the option to really do it, to go run straight to victory road with nothing but fuecoco and try to beat the champion like that, a possible route for anyone but still hard enough to turn any normal player into modern art if they try.",2022-12-16 21:38:39

As you may have heard, Ash is set to be retired from the anime starting with the new series in April 2023.

At this point, I just don't see where his character could go from here, at some point every characters arc has to end and Ash is arguably way past that point. But on the other hand... Ash is essentially the second face of Pokemon at this point and I'm not sure how they'll handle these new protagonists. idk, what do you guys think? is Ash being replaced a good thing?

My speculations for the Scarlet and Violet anime,3,znm8m9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znm8m9/my_speculations_for_the_scarlet_and_violet_anime/,4,1671217296.0,"We have a dual protagonists, Liko and Roy.

Liko seems like she originated from Kanto (evidence through the Kanto Pokémon League logo as a hairpin on her hair), but seems like she went to the Paldea to study in the Academy to like get closer to Pokémon or whatever.

Roy seems like a native in the region and also seems to be the battler of the protagonists as seen with him holding a pokeball (Ash’s vibe). He seems to have Fuecoco and Quaxly as part of his team but by his design which is mostly red, I suspect that Fuecoco is his first Pokémon and Quaxly being encountered and caught in the wild. His goal is to become a Pokémon champion which he need to take on all gym leaders which suggest the appearances of all the paldean gym leaders (unlike galar).

In the trailer, we saw a scene which is Liko first meeting her first Pokémon, Sprigatito. See that she was wearing a normal academy clothes and not the one in the promo. I suspect that she might be inspired by Roy‘s battlling and charisma, probably when she first saw him battling in the schoolyard with his fuecoco. 

They would properly meet later as Team Star get into the action. Team Star grunts would approached Liko to force to join them in which Liko would refused. This would anger the grunts and would physically force her to join them in which Roy would appear and stop them. This would prompt a battle between Roy and the grunts in which Roy would use terastallize Fuecoco and defeat the grunts. 

This would inspired her and prompt her to change her attire and want to join him on his journey during this year‘s treasure hunt, therefore, becoming companions.

This might be a stretch since all the evidence is coming from the first trailer and a promo art. But this is just speculation , I might be wrong.

I think we’ve all been waiting for a open world Pokémon game for years now and they definitely did deliver but it some things seem very lackluster to me. 

They added like 3 quest lines but watered them down. For instance when you’d go to a team rocket, aqua, magma whatever base you’d have to go through a series of trainers in a maze. Now you just have to run around and “beat 30 Pokémon” before facing the boss. Another thing is the cities are so interactive, you can’t even go inside half the buildings and everything you can go inside is freaking coffee shop or restaurant. Sure you can buy some accessories but you can’t seem to get out of the lame school uniform.

Pokémon Gimic Idea,1,znlcws,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znlcws/pokémon_gimic_idea/,5,1671214965.0,"So recently, I've been thinking about many ideas in regards to what my dream pokemon game would be like and one of the biggest things is, of course, a game where you are able to fuse two different Pokemon to something new to use in battles. But then I took a look at the Paradox Pokemon from Scarlet and Violet as well as shadow Pokemon from the Gale of Darkness and Colosseum and I decided that maybe I'd want to do something similar to one of the two or some form of combination that takes elements from both. Which do you all prefer?




As for how these Pokemon would be possible in my world, it would be more natural than something done by humans or something that's a result of reality being broken.

You see, in my region, there once existed two legendary pokemon (one a fairy type, and one a poison type) and when they both died - the areas where their remains were began to drastically change to the point where any pokemon that inhabited these areas would also begin to change, gaining new types, moves, designs and having special qualities that make them vary quite a bit from most other Pokemon (like how shadow Pokemon have qualities that make them different from non shadow Pokemon, and how Paradox Pokemon have qualities that make them different than non-Paradox Pokemon). Meanwhile, regular versions of the adapted pokemon still exist throughout the region. 

Ex: While there exists a Fairy Type Area Bisharp, there also exist regular Bisharp within the region

Let's talk about the new Anime Stuff.,4,znjjn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znjjn3/lets_talk_about_the_new_anime_stuff/,1,1671210292.0,"It was about time we got a new Anime Season, I was thinking that Ash would continue his journey in Paldea but unfortunately it isn't the case anymore, we're going to get an 11 Episode Special Season showing the Epilogue of Ash and Pikachu's Story, I'd like to say a few words before Ash leaves the anime as the Protagonist.

He has been our childhood hero, our role model, our boy who we were rooting for, He had a rough start in Kanto, in the Orange Islands he was learning much more, things started picking up in Johto, he became a better character in Hoenn and Sinnoh, Unova on the other hand not so much, then Ash matured in Kalos, had the time of his life and became the Champion of Alola, and now he is the Winner of the WCS and the strongest trainer in the world, now that his story with Pikachu is coming to an end, it's finally time to pass the torch.

I was hoping Ash would continue his quest to become a Pokemon Master but in the end, he's a Pokemon Master in our hearts, so this is it his story is almost over, and it makes me really sad, but happy.

As for the new Anime Series, it will be like a traditional Monster Taming Anime where someone passes the Torch to another protagonist, with Digimon, the writers made Davis the protagonist over Tai, with Yu-Gi-Oh, Yugi turned his role over to Jaden, with Beyblade Tyson converted his role from him to Gingka, but this time Ash is passing his torch to the name according to what the news online is saying, a girl named Liko, and her friend Roy, it's not confirmed if Liko is Ash's daughter, protégé or an entirely new character, the premise of the story is that Liko and Roy are going across the Paldea Region with all 3 Starters from Scarlet and Violet.

To be honest I like this new concept for the Pokemon Anime to go that direction, Ash has overstayed his welcome, and so did Pikachu, so it is time to turn the attention to a new protagonist, I have high hopes for this Anime Series.",2022-12-16 19:04:52
Tera raids of 5 stars and up feeling just stupidly unfair...,34,znjhi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znjhi1/tera_raids_of_5_stars_and_up_feeling_just/,41,1671210136.0,"Is it just me or 5 star raids and up are feeling a bit unfair?

I think that gyms should have themes instead of types. Obviously the early gyms or low-level gyms in games can still have types to help ease in newbies, but I think it'd be cool if the later/higher-level gyms used Pokemon of many different types but still centered around a theme, not just ""Fire"" or ""Psychic"" or whatever. Even now a lot of gym leaders will have some pokemon that break the mold (although in Scar/Vi it's only so they can terastalize them into the specialty type), and Blue used a multi-type team in Gold/Silver and the remakes, but those are the exceptions that prove the rule.

No, instead, I'm talking, like what if there was a ""Dog Gym"", ""Ape Gym"" or ""Cat Gym"" that used Pokemon based on those types of animals? Or a ""Embassy Gym"" where the leader only used Pokemon from a specific region (i.e. only Kantonian Pokemon or only Unovan Pokemon)? How about a ""Mimic Gym"" where every Pokemon has some sort of mimicry gimmick (Ditto, Zoroark, Mimikyu, Smeargle, etc.)? Perhaps a ""Pikachu Clone"" gym could serve as an early-level bridge between the type gym and the theme gym. 

It'd allow for more strategy (as you wouldn't be able to just load up on the type of Pokemon strong against a certain type), and also allow for a greater ranger of gym leader designs/concepts. 

I doubt that Gamefreak will ever do this on a wide scale for various reasons, but was wondering your thoughts/ideas.",2022-12-16 19:00:39

Let me explain why this chill monkey is anyone's friend. At lvl 65 he learns Instruct. Which means you can choose your teammate to repeat his move again. So team mate is doing Sword Dance. Boom now he has done it 2x in the same turn (depending on the lag and how quick you are) instead of two turns. 

Also meaning executing an attack double in one turn. Charizard get ready for that second Teralized Moonblast.

Besides that I gave him Reflect, Light Screen and Psychic (never needed it). Last slot could be used for other useful move. Item: Light Clay to extend the Reflect and Light Screen debuffs. Ability doesn't really matter. Gave him max IV in HP, Def and Sp Def. Along with max HP EV and 50/50 EV for Def and Sp Def. Perhaps not optimal but this is what I went with.

Oranguru has enough bulk in combination with the debuffs to survive long enough to let team mates wreck the Tera boss. 

So please use Oranguru as support. You won't regret it. It is another useful option instead of 4 Azumarills using Belly Drum and all fainting after that Hurricane

So there are two things that I hope the new anime series does.,4,zni6wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zni6wc/so_there_are_two_things_that_i_hope_the_new_anime/,8,1671206832.0,"And these are those two things:

1. Belonging in the same continuity as the previous anime series. I mean, it kind of worked with **Yu-Gi-Oh! GX**. It can work well with upcoming **Pokemon** anime series as well. Don't go for a hard reboot like **Digimon** does all the time since I don't think that's going to help the series - like, at all. Besides, it would make sense for the main character to start the journey because she was deeply inspired by Ash.

2. It's set only a year or two after the event of **Pokemon Journey**. Why? It's because of Pikachu. Now, I don't know how old Pikachu is in terms of human age, but right now, I'm assuming that his age is about as same as Ash in terms of human age, or maybe slightly younger. While I'm pretty sure that Pikachu has far longer lifespan than mice species, I kind of doubt that it would be on the level of human's life expectancy. Making the series set about a year or two gives it a good excuse to have Ash and Pikachu being recurring characters in the series like Cynthia was.

As for the new main Pokemon character... that's a tricky one. I could picture Eevee being the one, but the whole gimmick of Eevee is that it can evolve into several other Pokemons and I'm not entirely sure if Gigantamax Eevee would be enough. Maybe they could go with Pawmi this time? I mean, Pawmi is a new Electric Mouse Pokemon, and I would actually like to see it evolving in the series since that would help set it apart from Ash's Pikachu, who cannot evolve anyway since it's practically a Gigantamax Pikachu.

My Thoughts On Ash & Pikachus Farewell - The Changing Of The Guard,2,znho6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znho6q/my_thoughts_on_ash_pikachus_farewell_the_changing/,3,1671205542.0,"While I grew up with Pokemons earlier generations and began to slowly distance away from the show following Master Quest mainly due to growing up and losing interest in what made Pokemon work for me I could still appreciate the cultural impact the show had and the key to that was one, Ash Ketchum.

Now the reason I feel out of interest with Pokemon was because it was growing too much for me. I felt like there were far too many Pokemon being created when I was enjoying it being the original 150 which then was extended during the Johto days. By the time we had gotten to Advanced I didn't feel as connected to the show. Misty exiting also being one of the reasons I felt like it was time to move on. I enjoyed the dynamic of the original trio. While I popped in and out of the show over the years the one thing still remained and that was our boy Ash and Pikachu.

For me he was the glue holding things together. He and Team Rocket were long standing mainstays that kept things interesting. As a mature viewer you still peered in from time to time wondering if the kid from your childhood was going to achieve his dream he set out to do in episode 1:

""Spearows, do you know who I am?! I am Ash, from the town of Pallet! I'm destined to be the world's number one Pokémon Master. I can't be defeated by the likes of you!""

Fast forward and out boy finally did it. He became a Pokemon Master after a 20 plus year journey and the entire world rejoiced. Whether you still watched Pokemon religiouslu or not you were proud of that young boy who made that statement all those years ago. And now the news is that his journey is coming to an end... And here's my opinion.. And it may be an unpopular one.. The show should have also ended as a result.

Ash has been established as stated for the better part of two decades as the hero for kids and even adults to get behind. When his journey ends so should the show. It should have been the end game. Now these new characters enter and the first thing people will think.. Like it or not.. Is ""Will they measure up to Ash?"" And that trend will continue for a while making it difficult for them to fully establish their own identities.

Do you ever watch the newer version of some shows and think.. ""These guys aren't as good as the originals"" or you feel like the show has become too commercialised to the point where even the anime brand is just rinse and repeat? Theres no real depth to characters. You can plug literally anyone into the story and it wouldn't make a shadow of a difference. In ways that's also because of society's defiance to accept something new. They don't want to get to know the new people. They arent the people that they established a bond with for so long. They don't deserve a chance in their eyes. In some ways these new characters are going to run into that same issue.

Ash has been the face of the franchise for so long that fazing him out now is literally like rolling the dice. They are taking a chance on something new after so long but the problem is it may be too late to actually do so. You may have reached the point where new characters may draw a negative response rather than a positive one. I'm not saying don't give these new kids a chance but for me the journey started with Ash and it ends with him as well.

Ash Ketchum has defined many a childhood, myself included. The character has remained the same age and yet we all feel like we grew up with him in some way. And let's not forget Pikachu. Who would have thought that a yellow mouse with red cheeks would become the biggest mascot the show has ever seen? He wasn't one of the 1st pokemon. He was number 25. Quite ironic that isn't it? Pokemon number 25 is the most well known companion of the protagonist and the franchise as a whole for 25 years. It almost feels fitting.

Pikachu was the perfect companion for Ash. He just looked right on his shoulder. The question is now do they move away from that dynamic with the new cast or attempt to recreate it? Will it feel like a retread? All in all seeing Ash and Pikachu go will be sad. In my opinion the show should finish in their 11 episode special series but if the show must go on then it must go on.. Farewell Ash & Pikachu!",2022-12-16 17:45:42
"You can just ""Press A"" your way through 9 out of 18 Raid types with these three Pokemon (SV)",12,znhhx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znhhx4/you_can_just_press_a_your_way_through_9_out_of_18/,2,1671205132.0,"Figured I'd share this since I've been having easy Raids (even 6-star) with these three particular builds. I'll put the TL;DR bare bones info at the top then explain in detail why they work further down in the post.

These three won't cover every possible raid but significantly speed up the farming process so you can build more Pokemon like Goldengo, Hatterene, Annihilape, etc. for more specific raids. And yes, there are better Pokemon for raiding but if you're just starting to farm raids seriously, these are a great starting point because:

* A) They don't require their hidden abilities
* B) The only move you need for each one is learned naturally

&#x200B;

# TL;DR Builds

**Skeledirge**

* Tera Type: Fire
* Ability: doesn't matter but Unaware is ideal
* Modest
* hyper trained all IVs except Attack
* 252 HP, 252 Sp Atk
* Held Item: Shell Bell
* Torch Song in Slot 1, other moves are up to you
* Ideally Lv100

**Espathra**

* Tera Type: Psychic
* Ability: Opportunist
* Modest
* hyper trained all IVs except Attack
* 252 HP, 252 Sp Atk
* Held Item: Shell Bell
* Lumina Crash in Slot 1, other moves are up to you
* Ideally Lv100

**Flapple**

* Tera Type: Grass
* Ability: anything other than Hustle
* Adamant
* hyper trained all IVs except Special Attack
* 252 HP, 252 Atk
* Held Item: Shell Bell
* Grav Apple in Slot 1, other moves are up to you
* Ideally Lv100

&#x200B;

**TL;DR why it works:**

Each of these moves has 100 accuracy and guarantees more damage the next time you use it. Shell Bell keeps you healthy while you just spam an offensive move so your terastilization will be available very quickly.

You can brute force your way through pretty much any 3 and 4 star raid with any of these mons. 5-Star you can easily do any one you're super effective against and any you're neutral against (will just take a bit longer). 6-Star I'd recommend you stick to just the ones you're super effective against. I have found that max HP and Shell Bell keeps you healthy through even super effective hits so the Raid Pokemon's original type is negligible.

I would highly recommend doing this in solo raids though, since some Raid pokemon are bulkier or will use Clear Smog/Haze to nullify stat changes more often than the 1-time default.

With these three Pokemon, you have coverage for

* Grass, Bug, Ice, Steel (Skeledirge)
* Fighting, Poison (Espathra)
* Ground, Rock, Water (Flapple)

&#x200B;

# The Long Version

Each of these pokemon have a move that has 100 accuracy and guarantees additional damage the next time you use it in some way. In the case of Torch Song, it raises Skeledirge's special attack while Lumina Crash and Grav Apple guarantee the opposing pokemon becomes more susceptible to the move. Yes, the raid mon will reset stats at least once during the battle but who cares, just keep using the same move.

Since you're not wasting time with set up moves, your Terastilization will be available very quickly.

Max out your Pokemon's HP stat, slap a Shell Bell on it and go to town. It will keep you healthy since the harder you hit, the more HP you get back. With this, I found that the original type of the Raid Mon almost never matters, as you can drain tank your way through most raids even if they are hitting you with super effective damage.

I also found that you can be very greedy with your Terastilization and use it immediately when it becomes available since you're never really dangerously low (even in 6 star raids).

Lag in raids is frustrating, and you'll notice that sometimes the game will reset your cursor to the move in Slot 1 which is why you should put these moves in Slot 1 so you can just press A stress-free.

With these setups, you can comfortably solo the following raids:

* Any 3 and 4 Star Raids
* 5 Star raids that you are super effective against or neutral against
* 6 Star raids that you are super effective against

It goes without saying that there will be some mons that are just too frustrating (Yawn, Clear Smog, etc) but for the most part I've been able to use these to clear out most of the raids on my map. Or if you're just looking to farm candies and ability patches, you can forward your Switch's calendar by 1 day and just wait for a 6-star raid you're super effective against:

* Grass, Bug, Ice, Steel (Skeledirge)
* Fighting, Poison (Espathra)
* Ground, Rock, Water (Flapple)

Enter the raid and just press the A button until you can Tera. Press R and then back to pressing A until you've won. It's seriously that easy.

&#x200B;

# The Builds

**Skeledirge**

Tera Type - Fire

* Standard, you want the Tera type that matches the move you're spamming

Ability

* If you have a spare ability patch, give Skeledirge Unaware so it will ignore any stat boosts the raid mon has when you use Torch Song
* However, Blaze is totally fine

Stat Setup

* Modest nature (or feed it a Modest Mint)
* Use bottle caps to hyper train HP, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed
* 252 HP, 252 Sp Atk, 6 Def or Sp Def
* This makes you thicc and hit like a truck

Moves

* Torch Song (make sure it's in slot 1 and use any PP UPs you have to max it out)
* Other three don't really matter but I went with Flamethrower (on the off chance I get Tormented), Shadow Ball and Snarl

Held Item

* Shell Bell, with this you will rarely drop to red HP as each attack will pretty much heal you to full

Coverage

* Bring Skeledirge to any Grass, Bug, Ice or Steel raid and you can just brute force your way through it by pressing A
* The original type of the raid mon rarely matters, as your bulk and Shell Bell should be enough to keep you alive

How to Get

* If you didn't choose Fuecoco as your starter, don't worry. Find yourself a Ditto and breed with the starter you do have, then head over to [r/pokemontrades](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/) where folks are regularly exchanging baby starters for the ones they don't have.

&#x200B;

**Espathra**

Tera Type - Psychic

* Standard, you want the Tera type that matches the move you're spamming

Ability

* Opportunist, matches any positive stat changes made by the opposing mon

Stat Setup

* Modest nature (or feed it a Modest Mint)
* Use bottle caps to hyper train HP, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed
* 252 HP, 252 Sp Atk, 6 Def or Sp Def
* This makes you thicc and hit like a truck

* Lumina Crash (make sure it's in slot 1 and use any PP UPs you have to max it out)
* Other three don't really matter but I went with Psychic (on the off chance I get Tormented), Dazzling Gleam and Calm Mind

Held Item

* Shell Bell, with this you will rarely drop to red HP as each attack will pretty much heal you to full

Coverage

* Bring Espathra to any Fighting or Poison raid and you can just brute force your way through it by pressing A
* The original type of the raid mon rarely matters, as your bulk and Shell Bell should be enough to keep you alive

How to Get

* There is a pokemon center at the northeast of the map where Espathra spawn like Zubat around the area. Alternatively there is one that respawns daily in the middle of the desert area.

&#x200B;

**Flapple**

Tera Type - Grass

* Standard, you want the Tera type that matches the move you're spamming

Ability

* Either of the standard abilities (Gluttony or Ripen). Literally does not matter as they both deal with berries which we're not using.
* Do not use its Hidden Ability Hustle which reduces your accuracy.

Stat Setup

* Adamant nature (or feed it an Adamant Mint)
* Use bottle caps to hyper train HP, Defense, Attack, Special Defense and Speed
* 252 HP, 252 Atk, 6 Def or Sp Def
* This makes you thicc and hit like a truck

Moves

* Grav Apple (make sure it's in slot 1 and use any PP UPs you have to max it out)
* Other three don't really matter but I went with Trailblaze (on the off chance I get Tormented), Dragon Dance and Dragon Rush

Held Item

* Shell Bell, with this you will rarely drop to red HP as each attack will pretty much heal you to full

Coverage

* Bring Flapple to any Ground, Rock or Water raid and you can just brute force your way through it by pressing A
* The original type of the raid mon rarely matters, as your bulk and Shell Bell should be enough to keep you alive

Where to Get

* Run full speed into trees in the poison team star area, if you're lucky an Appletun will drop.
* Alternatively, I've seen plenty of Appletun and Flapple while farming Tera Raids so you can catch one that way but you'll have to change its Tera type to Grass.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps a lot of you out. These three mons have become my go to when I don't feel like setting up with 2-3 different moves while the raid lag takes my UI away for what feels like an eternity.

It also goes without saying that these three won't cover every possible raid, however they will help you farm the candies and ability patches you need to build more Pokemon, as well as a lot of sellable items so you can make money and buy vitamins, mints, bottle caps, etc.

For example, I was able to build the perfect Hatterene which made it incredibly easy to solo the Charizard raids for even more candies and patches and it just snowballed from there. I now have nearly two full boxes of raid-ready pokemon and another box full of competitive ready pokemon.",2022-12-16 17:38:52

After 25 years of laughs, happiness and tears. Last year I made a post about how I thought it was the end for Ash and Pikachu but not a lot of people believed me. Some of the things I imagined happening probably won’t. But I want one last guess as to how the last episode goes.


(Scene Pallet town)

Ash’s mom: Hey Ash! Dinner will be ready in an hour.

Ash: Thanks mom but we we’re actually going to head over to Professor oaks lab.

Ash’s mom: Ok well just make sure you’re in time for dinner.

(At professor oaks lab)

Prof oak Aid: Sorry he’s not here right now.

Ash: Aw man do you know when he’ll be back?

Prof oak aid: (shakes his head) no idea.

Ash: Ok well thanks. Alright Pikachu let’s go get some of mom’s delicious food! 

(Ash turns to go home when a voice from behind stops him)

May: Ash!

Ash: hm? Oh Hey May!

May: I didn’t expect to see you here.

Ash: well you know I thought about coming home for awhile. What about you why are you here. 

May: Oh me? I just came by to see professor Oak is all. But hey while we’re here why don’t we catch up?

(Back at Ash’s moms house)

Professor Oak: So todays the big day?

Ash’s mom: It sure is!
(Dawn walks through the door)

Dawn: Sorry I hope I’m not to late!

Ash’s mom: don’t worry dawn you’re right on time. 

(Back outside professor Oaks lab.)

May: So yeah I think that catches us up on everything!

Ash: That’s so cool May! 

(Ash gets concerned) 

Ash: Woah it’s already been an hour!? Sorry May I gotta get going I promised mom I’d be home for dinner! Huh I know why don’t you come too! Mom always makes a lot!

May: I’d love too!

(They walk towards ash’s house, as they approach they notice how dark the house is)

Ash: Huh I wonder why it’s so dark 


(He turns the handle and steps inside the dark house when all of a sudden…)

Everyone: SURPRISE 

(Ash’s friends from his journeys as well as his mom and professor oak jump out and shoot confetti at him)

Ash’s mom: Sorry if we scared you Ash we just wanted to do something to celebrate.

Ash: But mom celebrate what?

(Everyone stairs at Ash)

(Dawn snickers) you always were so forgetful.

(Ash thinks for a minute) Oh I totally forgot. 

Professor Oak: well Ash it’s not every day a young man turns 11.

(With that everyone eats cake and celebrates Ashs birthday as the credits roll)

I haven't watched journeys as I thought that Ash and Pikachu would always stick around for the next younger generations to watch, but after two months, I found out from Twitter and Youtube that the final battle with Leon was happening. It may come as people's surprise, but I was one of the few who wanted Ash not to win, as it would mean that his journey would end as he would achieve his goal of being the world champion. Sadly, he did, and during that time, I was thinking about whether they (Ash and Pikachu) would continue being the main characters until today, I heard that Pokemon will release an eleven-episode special of their final journey in January 2023 along with a new series which as mentioned revolves around two protagonists that do not involve Pikachu. 

I did not know what to feel but felt that all the characters that I grew up with are all gone now, Tai and Agumon from Digimon Adventure 1999, Tyson and Dragoon from Beyblade, Yugi and Yami Yugi from Yugioh, Dan Kuso and Drago from Bakugan and now it looks like it is time to say goodbye to the remaining piece in my childhood.  Although Ash was not the most likable character at times, especially in the Hoenn region, he can make you like him later due to learning from his mistakes and becoming what he is today.... a champion. I am not sure what to say about the new anime, but I hope that it won't disappoint the fans, as getting someone new as the main character after 25 years is not something they will get used to.... so I do wish they won't let us down.

What does Pokemon mean to you?,20,znfxa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znfxa9/what_does_pokemon_mean_to_you/,17,1671200904.0,"This question has probably already been asked a million times on Reddit, but the recent announcement of Ash's journey finally concluding is making me somewhat nostalgic. 

My background: a millennial born in India.

The trailer of the first series came around 2003, I remember seeing Ash, and Pikachu on a tree branch, and thought how cool that yellow mouse was. I was so surprised and happy when Ash got the mouse in the first episode itself.

I was in love with Pokemon. Mon-Fri 5pm was reserved for Pokemon. There was a time when the cable provider in our town removed Cartoon Network. I never told anything to anyone, but I used to cry sometimes before sleeping lol. 

Didn't have trading cards in my town. I just used to collect stickers, tazos, Jenga cards, anything i could get my hands on. My dad would take me to every shop in the town. Some shopkeepers would just give their cards for free, some would charge some money. Had collected a total of 1854 cards (still have em :D)

Got my computer around 7th standard. By 9th 10th I would like, find GBA emulators, play the games, amazing times.

I remember Pokemon Go released during my Bachelor's, but me not being able to play it because my phone couldn't support the game. After completing the Bachelors 1 week before my job started, the first thing I did was to buy a OnePlus 3t which would support Pokemon Go. I was playing it in 2019, when people around me had mostly moved on, but I couldn't care less, it meant so much for me, and i enjoyed playing it so much.

Got a Nintendo Switch after doing Masters. Have played Sw, PLA, and Violet so far. I don't consider anything in life to be success or failure, because it is such a subjective thing, but finally being able to play the true Pokemon games on the original console makes me very happy.

Pokemon has been a constant in my life. These magical creatures with amazing powers and characteristics fascinate me so much. There have been so many lows in my life, Pokemon has always been something which never failed to spark joy and wonder in my eyes, and one of the things which keep me going.

I can go on and on about how Ash's journey taught me so many important life lessons: you will not always achieve your dreams in the first try, hard work and dedication pays off in multiple ways, how to handle competition, how to maintain friendships as you move from one place to another in your life, how to properly say and handle goodbyes. 

But yeah, that was Pokemon for me. Would love to hear what it means for you.",2022-12-16 16:28:24

What I mean is that: How are HMs / TMs / TRs physically used on Pokémon to teach moves? I always vision that you have a TV and you’ll put the TM into the TV and the Pokémon watches a video, after that, the Pokémon tries out the move while forgetting another.
In FiRe/LeG (am I the only one that shortens games like that?), when you use a HM / TM on a Pokémon, an animation plays with the TM / HM put on the Pokémon's head and it being ""absorbed"" into the Pokémon, consuming it.

Some of my castings include Brittney Karbowski as Dawn because her somewhat raspy voice reminds me of Emily Jenness, who voices Dawn in the anime.

For me, it’s watching Battle Frontier for the first time on Cartoon Network when I was about six years old, which eventually lead to me watching the premiere of Diamond and Pearl. At the time, I didn’t have a DS, so this the anime was how I kept up with the franchise.

Or also being reintroduced to the series when I was twelve, watching Advance Challenge reruns on Boomerang and eventually deciding to watch the new episodes. I remember being obsessed with the show during this time, I would watch new episodes of Black & White every Saturday morning on Cartoon Network and record the Diamond and Pearl reruns when they aired on evenings on Boomerang. The series always looped back to Kanto after it finished up Sinnoh (always starting with the The Problem With Paras episode) and I’d rewatch every time.

I mean they even got as far as featuring a Eevee themed main character (Penny), but didn't realy make use of that.

She only uses Eeveelutions and is obviously very fond of them.

Pennys hair colour matches the old Dragon type icon.

She gives you Dravo Meteor after beating her.

Galar's Battle Tower: Good or Bad?,8,zndo83,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zndo83/galars_battle_tower_good_or_bad/,3,1671194149.0,"A lot of people here are saying that *Sword* and *Shield's* version of the Battle Tower is the worst one yet, but I don't think I agree. I think the new Battle Tower is more accessible in some ways than the Towers of old. Let me explain:

In *Pokémon Sword* and *Shield,* instead of having to earn a win streak, the Battle Tower uses a ranking system to emulate online. In fact, this facility explicitly tells you it's trying to prepare for online. This means that every time you win, you gain points, and every time you lose, you lose points. You can rank up or down, but once you reach a new tier (i.e. Great Ball Tier, Ultra Ball Tier) you cannot rank out of that tier. Usually, you'll have to fight Champion Leon to reach a new rank/tier iirc.

I like this new system because I believe it's more sensible than a win streak. You still have to be good at the game, but you don't have to be *perfect.* In my opinion, 50 wins *in a row* is a pretty tall order, even if you're good at the game. You could be doing great just to have your win streak removed due to bad RNG! In this new system though, losing is punished but not as severely. I think this is more accessible because it allows people to improve and learn from their mistakes easier.

Now, this Tower isn't without its flaws. Once you reach the Master Ball Tier, the Battle Tower eventually becomes... too easy, like the main game. Unless you start using new pokémon, it's kinda easy to start turning your brain off in battles. I know that's what happened to me after a while (Shout out to Galarian Darmanitan and Sirfetch'd lol).

The second bad thing is the exclusion of the Vs. Recorder. Seriously GAME FREAK, where the heck is Battle Video!? Not only could you watch your replays, but you could also do Mock Battles! This meant that you could essentially retry battles you lost as much as you wanted to improve! It was an invaluable tool which, in the *Pokémon* series, meant it had to be removed.

So those are my two cents. If you're looking for more of a ""classic"" Battle Tower experience, you can try the Isle of Armor's Restricted Sparring. Granted, you have to pay an extra 30 dollars for it (among other content), but this facility is pretty great. It might be my favorite battle facility ever, and this is coming from a guy who played HGSS's Battle Frontier. All I know is that these two facilities are better than having nothing (looking at *you,* SV).",2022-12-16 14:35:49

Turns out I don't know anything about Pokemon like I thought I did lmao. I can think of at least 3 instances where I have been the sole reason we got destroyed. 

Main example that will forever haunt me: Azumarill popped up, I want to say as a Water Tera type? (Might've been Normal tho) We're all choosing our Pokemon, everyone is choosing grass-types, one being Meowscarada, so I choose him as well. Not gonna be great if they use a fairy attack, but what's the worst that could happen? 

I have never used Azumarill, or apparently never tried a grass type against it before, was the worst time to find out that, not only is it immune to grass moves, IT MAKES IT STRONGER. AND THEN it's rude self uses ENCORE so I continue to make it stronger. I hit it 3x with Seed Bomb since I didn't notice the first time, and it used Encore the second. Then my poor teammates start to get one-shot. Oops. 

I think it goes without saying that we did not win that fight.

I'm under the assumption (or at least I hope) they were choosing grass for the defense benefits, or they were all as clueless as me. That would make me feel less bad, but seems unlikely. 

So yeah, sorry to those guys, that was uh, my bad. Very glad it's anonymous. Half glad there's no chat so no one can yell at me, half wish there was, so they could tell me ""hey don't use/choose that you idiot""

Hello friends! I'm back into Pokémon after being on hiatus for the last few generations, and I'm really enjoying Pokemon S/V. There's been quite a few changes in the marking system since I was last playing seriously in Gen 6. Back then I used the marking system To show IV's Of course with the order being: HP,Atk,Def,Sp.Atk,Sp.Def,Spd. But now we have the option of not only marking with 6 different shapes, but marking in Red and Blue Marks as well.

I'd love to use this new system to it's fullest, making Pokemon easy to find in Home, Bank, In PC, Ect. I've got a draft of a system that I'm Thinking about using, but It could use some work. Said system is as follows:

|Mark Colour|Circle|Triangle|Square|Heart|Star|Diamond|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Blue**|Received in Trade|Event/Sentimental|Competitive|EV Trained|Cool Ball|Perfect Stats|
|**Red**|Available to Trade|To Level Up|Utility|To EV Train|Shiny|Some Stats/Bottlecap|

  


I took some inspiration from an [infographic](https://twitter.com/pkmncast/status/1227689516015722497) I found on the topic. But in many ways it felt like It could do so much more, and felt a little outdated. (Like having a mark for Dynamax)  


So it is with this state of excitement and confusion that I come to ask you /r/Pokemon, How do you like to use the marking system? Do you have any suggestions on improvements I could make on mine?",2022-12-16 07:58:16

It's a personal project so it's not perfect or all-encompassing.

"As a major Gen V fan, Unova started my least favorite trend in Pokémon Games",6,zn2le6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zn2le6/as_a_major_gen_v_fan_unova_started_my_least/,4,1671154392.0,"Ok so to preface, SV completely shatters this trend but it was in the games from Gen V through VIII so it’s notable for mainline games. Also important is that I adore Gen V this is not a hater post just an observation that I think Unova fans ignore. The observation in question is that Gen V really started the aggressive linearity of Pokémon games. 

Let’s start by looking at the earlier games. Sinnoh had a number of small interconnected loops and Mt Coronet kind of dividing them. Regardless you could really go between areas with a good level of freedom and there was a nice amount of backtracking. Hoenn also had large amount of looped areas and backtracking. Johto is so free that they destroyed the level curve to ensure that freedom. Kanto had a ton of freedom with the tunnels and side routes.

So what does Unova do differently? The difference is immediate just by looking at the map. Rather than an interconnected web of areas, Unova is a circle with a tail. This means that you can only physically move in a single direction, massively stifling freedom. Furthermore, almost every single area breaks down into “beat gym/team plasma -> cross bridge or cave -> repeat.”

Fun fact: that’s not even a joke. Striaton Gym, Dreamyard Plasma event, cross tiny garden bridge. Nacrene Gym, Pinwheel Plasma event, cross Skyarrow bridge. Plasma event, Castelia Gym, desert route (one of the rare non cave/bridge connecting paths). Nimbasa Gym, Driftveil Drawbridge. Frigate, Driftveil Gym, Chargestone Cave. Celestial Tower, Mistralton Gym, Twist Mountain. Iccirus Gym, Dragonspiral Tower, that one bridge. Opelucid Gym, Relic Castle, Victory Road.

It’s all bridges and caves. Now people might point out similar formulas in other games but they were always more open and less formulaic. You could do Slateport and the Trick House before Dewford. The issue with Unova comes with two main worsening factors.

Factor one is the lack of the Illusion of Nonlinearity. Even if the games are linear, the regions prior at least pretended to *look* nonlinear. The looping paths might not contribute to much but they added a sense of connectivity and realness to the region. Unova by comparison feels weird, especially in the context of it being Manhattan. No place is just a massive circle with basically nothing in the middle. Manhattan alone is a network of grid paths. Any train network across any distance has connecting filaments that look more like a spider web than a circle. The lack of this illusion of choice, makes the existing railroading feel completely inescapable, as there is no alternative in sight. It also really takes me out of the game because why should someone living in Opelucid have to go all the way around instead of just taking a path straight down (and no I don’t buy planes as an excuse that distance is short enough for a train or highway).

Exacerbating factor number 2 is that this region design stifles the existence of optional areas or paths. In terms of optional content in the main story, there is: 
* Relic Castle and the Desert Resort (which is good)
* The water routes by Numeva (which are good)
* the empty cave with Cobalion in the post game
* Lostlorn Forest (which is like one screen but kind of nice)

The big issue with these areas is that they are tiny buds rather than legitimate branching pathways. The optional areas are pretty but lack substantial content (outside of trainers) or cool opportunities to backtrack. Optional routes like the one south of Meteor Falls or Mt Coronets entire existence create organic reasons to return to places like Rustboro or Eterna. In Unova, once I leave somewhere I can basically remove it from my mind (except Nacrene which you return to for a single scene).

The worst part of this issue is that is creates a number of serious issues with Unova, which often stifle my enjoyment of the game. First off is the aforementioned lack of returning to towns or areas. Towns in Unova are rich and full of lore and detail, but the game basically suggests that I completely forget previous areas as I traverse the region. Second is immersion. I mentioned this already but no place looks like a big circle and it makes it hard to immerse myself in Unova when the map is a big circle (with a better region design, Unova could easily be the *most* immersive region). 

Third is how it weakens the gameplay loop. If the paragraph where I recapped BWs gym challenge felt tedious, it’s because the game often feels tedious. Areas like Wayward Cave, the Johto Safari Zone, or obtaining the EXP Share in Hoenn felt like meaningful diversions from the gameplay loop with substantial rewards and actual events happening. The optional content in Unova is just a bunch of trainers. Fourth is similar, but Unova is seriously lacking in meaningless towns, aka towns without gyms. Every region has 8 gym towns, 1 starter town, and 1 intro town (Oldale, Accumula, etc). However, regions prior, used additional “meaningless” towns to create settings for minor events or just paths to connect up to. In Sinnoh alone, we have Celestic Town, Floaroma Town, Valor Resort, Jubilife (kinda), and Solaceon Town. Unovas giant circle doesn’t really have the room for there areas, meaning we miss out on areas like this. These towns add a lot in terms of optional content/visuals and in creating immersion. It’s weird for an entire region to have only towns with gyms in them. The worst part is that Undella, Lacunosa, and the Village Bridge are AMAZING but they remained locked in the post game. Finally, it limits replay value a little bit. Johto creates optional paths or ways to play the game and Sinnoh creates a number of ways to traverse the region. Moving in a single line instead of choosing a branch makes walking down the hallway the second time a little more boring.

Now I will say that BW2 try their best to work around this. Two years doesn’t justify major changes in the region structure, but the game does its best to rework the structure. Twist Mountain and Relic Cave are used to link up existing areas, promoting backtracking (kinda cuz Twist Mountain is closed but I’ll give it to Game Freak). Flying to Lentimas and adding Humilau alters the gameplay path and creates some small loops (Giant Chasm to Lacunosa and Humilau to Undella via route and tunnel). There is also a little more substantial optional content with Pokestar Studios, the PWT, and the Strange House.

My biggest issue with BW2 is just that they tried their best to fix something with fundamental issues. You might have more freedom of movement but a glance at the map reveals a bandaid solution. The map is still a giant circle with a gaping hole around the Entralink, they just added an area and connecting path or two. The fact that the linkages are mostly via dotted lines really makes it obvious how thin the solutions truly are, but they are there I guess.

All in all, Unova had great stories, solid battles, a super cool set of new Pokémon, and rich towns and lore. Sadly all of this was kneecapped a little bit by a stifling region design and repetitive gameplay loop. The biggest tragedy for me is how clearly Unovas issues were passed on. Kalos is identical in the circle with trail structure (I guess there’s a small outcropping too). Alola is a bunch of small circles (but at they least they bother to hide it with the detailed maps). Galar is just a bunch of smaller circles separated by Wild Areas. Thankfully SV eliminated the issue (in mainline games) by going open world, but starting the trend of overly linear regions will remain a blemish on Gen Vs otherwise great reputation (at least for me).",2022-12-16 03:33:12

Possible Slightly Improved Method for SV Shiny Authentic Sinistea?,2,zmw10l,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zmw10l/possible_slightly_improved_method_for_sv_shiny/,7,1671138214.0,"Apologies if this is already wildly known, just doing some theory-crafting during some downtime at work.

As far as I understand, hunting for authentic Sinistea (never mind a shiny one) is extremely difficult in SV compared to SwSh. Sure, it's much easier to determine if a Sinistea is authentic or not with the mobile camera, and being able to see shinies in the overworld is obviously much better. 

Unfortunately, the game seems coded (or perhaps bugged, since Tatsugiri has a similar issue) to prevent any of the current shiny hunting tools from working properly. Sinistea outbreaks appear to only spawn Phony form.  And if you make a sandwich to increase shiny chance and encounter rate, you will only get phonies during that 30 minutes. The encounter-boosting code used (presumably) by both outbreaks and sandwiches only pulls in the first form for a particular species; hence only getting Curly Tatsugiri and Phony Sinistea.

But what if we just made a shiny-boosting sandwich that didn't also boost encounter rates? Would that prevent this ""bug"" from occurring, allowing you get a boosted shiny rate while being able to find Authentic Sinistea?

[This *extremely simple* recipe is for Ghost Sparkling, Title, and Humungo powers.](https://i.imgur.com/AXNXLwz.png) Just a single serving of Red Onion, plus Wasabi and any two Herba Mystica* (The last power will be different depending on which exact Herba Mystica you use; Spicy and Salty as seen here gives Humungo Power, but Sour and Sweet give Catching Power, Bitter and Sour give Item Drop Power, and Spicy and Sweet give Raid Power. I can confirm the Humungo and Catching variants to be accurate and work in-game. The others I can't say 100% on, but I imagine these two will be the most useful for people anyway; Humungo for bigger Sinistea so you can see the mark better, catching to make catching that authentic shiny in your one Dream Ball easier.)

In theory, one could go outside Alfornada, knock-out 60 Sinistea for the further shiny odds boost, then **save**, make a Red Onion Sandwich, and just start running around to spawn Sinistea naturally. It's still going to take a long time, but by my math this gives you 1/51,244 odds to find an Authentic Shiny Sinistea rather than the 1/409,600 you normally get. Significantly better, though admittedly still awful compared to the Smash Tea method in SwSh.

I do wonder if the phony and authentic forms are considered ""different Pokemon"" by the game, like how SwSh did. If so, you'd probably want to specifically knock out 60 Authentic Sinistea for those boosted odds, which would take even MORE time of course.

So... any merits to this idea?",2022-12-15 23:03:34

Anybody want to brainstorm about Pokémon Australian region?,0,zmu474,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zmu474/anybody_want_to_brainstorm_about_pokémon/,14,1671133503.0,"I've seen some excellent ideas in reference to a Pokémon Australian region and what Pokémon would be there and I have some ideas to toss in the ring myself and would like to hear what other people would have to add. I'll make a list with bullet points for clean reading.

1.) In many of the ideas I have seen I have noticed that there is a general Consensus that the water type starter should be a Platypus and I think that this is an excellent idea but I have a personal view on how this should be established, this being that the Platypus shouldn't start as a platypus but be made into one in stages. stage 1 should be simply a water starter that appears to be an otter. stage 2 should add a beaver tail. stage 3 should complete the platypus with a duck bill.

2.)   the safari zone (in theory) only has foreign Pokémon so Kangaskhan is probably from the Australian region and thus is the kangaroo pokemon already but a regional variant would be nice. There's like 4 types of kangaroo that they could make entries for each of them and just have Kangaskhan represent one of them (my guess would be one of the Gray Kangaroos). The funny thing is that Kangaskhan in the games have all been female so far, so the australian region would be an excellent chance to introduce the male version!! Perhaps a whole new entry in the pokedex for the males should be created along with a separate name (like Kangasgurkhan because Gur Khan means supreme Khan and mongolian titles were male centric) They should definitely fix the whole kangaskhan hatching from eggs with baby in pouch thing though by adding a pre-evolved form explanation and why it's only encountered in a mature kangaskhan pouch such as ""when kangaskhan hatch from eggs the previous kangaskhan baby evolves into a full grown kangaskhan and the new baby takes it's place in the mothers pouch"" thus meaning that every time we hatch a kangaskhan egg, there's one that enters the original kangaskhan pouch and there's one that evolves into an adult male or female kangaskhan. This change should also include a name for the kangaskhan pre-evolved form and a sprite created for a female kangaskhan without a baby with reduced stats which would change after an egg was hatched from that kangaskhan.

3.)  Cyndaquil is an Echidna Pokémon already and they're already doing regional variants of Pokémon so I think that they should just do a regional variant of Cyndaquil in the region as the original form of Cyndaquil.

4.)  The fossil pokemon pair to be the Thylacine (Tasmanian Wolf or Tasmanian Tiger) and the Thylacoleo (""pouch lion"" is an extinct genus of carnivorous marsupials that lived in Australia from the late Pliocene to the late Pleistocene (2 million to 46 thousand years ago). Some of these marsupial lions were the largest mammalian predators in Australia of their time, with Thylacoleo carnifex approaching the weight of a lioness. The estimated average weight for the species ranges from 101 to 130 kg (223 to 287 lb))

My thought is that the Thylacine could be revived from a genetic sample that you would have to obtain from a quest for one NPC looking to revive a recently extinct species and that the Thylacoleo could be obtained from a quest for another NPC looking to revive a long extinct species but you can only do one because whichever one you choose to pursue, your rival will pursue the other. This will result in the Rivals team having a spot on it that is occupied by the Fossil Pokemon. It would also be nice if these were fossil Pokémon that had a 3 stage evolution but I wouldn't hold my breath on that.

5.)  the Cane toad should included too. My thought is that it should be a truly gargantuan Toad because the Cane toad is the largest Toad species in the world and should they ever do a south American region then they should do a either an evolution based on or a regional Variant which is even bigger for the Suriname Cane toad which is the largest sub-species of Cane toads. I would prefer it that they did a 3 stage evolution for this idea because it would be nice to have a tadpole form for this evolution tree, that was one of the charming things about Poliwrath. Poison type should definitely be included because their toxin can drop a Saltwater crocodile, the other type I'm unsure of but it shouldn't be poison/fighting because that would just be a Toxicroak clone. I'd like a ground/poison although paldean Wooper/Clodsire is a thing and so is nidoking and nidoqueen but I will say that the most notable thing about the cane toad crisis in australia is not only that it is a huge toad, it is also that it has incredibly strong toxic defenses that drop almost anything outside of south america that preys on it and high durability for the foreign environment and from that ground/poison is the best durable typing that I think that this pokemon can be given to reflect that.

6.) I think sugar gliders should be included as a fairy/flying type just because they're as cute as can be

7.) The hercules moth should be included because it is the moth with the largest surface area in the world and it is endemic to australia.

8.)The Burrowing Cockroach is native to australia and I think that  they would be an excellent ground/bug or rock/bug type to reflect that they are also the heaviest species of roach in the world

9.) The Roseate cockatoos would make a wonderful addition especially since they are known to be pests in australia and they have a known habit of biting pet kangaroo tails (in a place called Victoria) to get them to move so that they can steal their food.

10.) Giant Cuttlefish because they are strange and just don't get enough recognition as it is and they are near australian coasts. also omanyte/omastar isn't a cuttlefish for anyone thinking that, they are based on ammonites.  here's some cuttlefish info: One member of this family that already attracts underwater photographers Down Under is the wonderful giant cuttlefish (*Sepia apama*). Growing to a length of over 1m, these huge cephalopods are found throughout Australia’s temperate seas. Giant cuttlefish are often curious of divers, and have been known to follow a diver around a dive site, and grab torches, gauges and cameras. While giant cuttlefish can be seen anywhere across their range, Whyalla in South Australia is the best place to observe them. Each winter, thousands of giant cuttlefish gather on the rocky reefs near Whyalla to breed, the only mass breeding of any cuttlefish species in the world.

11.)  The wobbegong shark should be included because they are another well known creature in australian waters and they have a truly unique appearance. here are some facts for them:

**Wobbegong sharks.** The most iconic family of sharks found in Australia waters would have to be the wobbegongs or wobbies. The wobbegong family contains twelve species, ten of which are found in Australian waters. The name ""wobbegong"" is an Australian Aboriginal word meaning “shaggy beard”, which is a great description of these unusual sharks that have a flattened body, colourful skin patterns and a fleshy beard around the head. Most wobbies inhabit tropical waters, but the two largest members of the family are found in southern Australia.

The spotted wobbegong (*Orectolobus maculatus*) is one of the most common shark species found in southern Australia. Growing to a length of 3.2m, these large sharks are found on rocky reefs and shipwrecks from southern Western Australia to southern Queensland. While they can turn up anywhere across their range, they are most abundant off New South Wales. These large ambush predators are easy to approach for photographs as they spend most of their time lazing on the bottom and waiting for prey to swim close enough to be snatched. But be warned, they don’t like to be harassed or cornered, and many a diver has been bitten by a stirred-up wobby.

The other wobby species that divers encounter in southern Australia is the banded wobbegong (*Orectolobus halei*). This species is found over much the same area as the spotted wobbegong, and reaching a length of 2.9m, it isn’t much smaller. This species prefers to shelter in caves and overhangs, so is not seen as often as the spotted wobbegong, which like to rest out in the open. Both banded and spotted wobbegongs can be seen at dive sites throughout New South Wales, with Jervis Bay and Sydney having a good population.

12.) Goanna with ground/dark typing due to their burrowing nature and natural sneakiness. this would be a welcome addition because the only other ground/dark types are Sandile/Krokorok/Krookodile and Ting-lu.

13.) Tasmanian Devil with Dark/fighting type due to the inherent violence that they exhibit. it would also add another to the list of fight/dark types which is lacking because the only others are scrafty/scraggy and pangoro.

14.) I think that both Emus and Cassowaries should be listed as variations of the fighting type because they are both australian and flightless and known for deadly kicks. also Australia once lost a war on emus

15.) Fairy penguins live in australia and the name alone is enough to decide what typing the Pokémon based on it should receive: fairy/ice. which is good since the only other fairy/ice that I know of is Alolan Ninetales.

16.) The Oenpelli Python also deserves some recognition for it's unusual characteristics as a constrictor snake, it could also be one of the few Pokémon to have the abilities color change and protean like kecleon does. here's some facts about the Oenpelli Python:

**OENPELLI PYTHON**

The Oenpelli python is a species of large snake in the family Pythonidae. The species is endemic to the sandstone massif area of the western Arnhem Land region in the Northern Territory of Australia. There are no subspecies that are recognised as being valid. It has been called the rarest python in the world. Two notable characteristics of the species are the unusually large size of its eggs and its ability to change colour.

17.) Sydney Leaf tailed gecko. it's just a unique gecko from australia that could fill in for the grass type

18.) The Northern blue tongue skink is an australian blue tongue and they are commonly sold as pets in the exotic pet trade. they are plainly charming and here's some facts about them from an article to be used for inspiration in determining what kind of pokemon they would be:

**NORTHERN BLUE-TONGUED SKINK**

The northern blue-tongued skink is the largest and heaviest of the blue-tongued lizards . They are native to Australia and found almost exclusively in the Northern Region. They generally live around 20 years and are commonly kept as pets.

19.) Ranoidea Platycephala , commonly known as the water-holding frog, is a frog common to most Australian states. It differs from most other members of the family Pelodryadidae as a ground dweller and the ability to aestivate. It can live for five years without drinking. the abilities are unique so it's worth a mention for the list of possible animals to be made into a Pokémon.

20.)  **AUSTRALIAN SCRUB PYTHON because I feel that there is a serious lack in snakes within Pokémon and this definitely needs remedying, here's some facts about them:**

The Australian scrub python is a species of snake in the family Pythonidae. The species is indigenous to forests of northern Australia. It is one of the world's longest and largest snakes, and is the longest and largest in Australia. Recently, it has been reclassified to the genus Simalia alongside a few other former Morelia species, but there is still a bit of scientific debate over this.

there was another user who posted about the Pokémon possibilities and I do agree with some of their ideas such as with the saltwater crocodile, bilby, magpie, possum, wombat,  funnel web spider, kookaburra, and (possibly) the dingo. here's a link to their post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/dvmjyq/my\_idea\_for\_a\_pokemon\_region\_based\_on\_australia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/dvmjyq/my_idea_for_a_pokemon_region_based_on_australia/)

I do disagree about how they wanted to to type the Goanna because Goannas are more well known for their burrows. here's a qoute from an article ""These corkscrew *V. panoptes* burrows are the first helical burrows known for any reptile, and also the deepest nesting excavations produced by any tetrapod."" and here's the article itself: [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/goannas-dig-the-deepest-twistiest-burrows-of-all/#:\~:text=A%20female%20Yellow%2Dspotted%20monitor,spiralling%20burrow%20near%20her%20tail](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/goannas-dig-the-deepest-twistiest-burrows-of-all/#:~:text=A%20female%20Yellow%2Dspotted%20monitor,spiralling%20burrow%20near%20her%20tail).

I also disagree with the typing that they chose for the Tasmanian Devil because they are known for their brutal nature

my final disagreement is with the Cassowary because they are flightless

Is my fakemon's stats/ability OP?,0,zmolw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zmolw3/is_my_fakemons_statsability_op/,7,1671119998.0,"I'm currently writing a pokemon fanfic in a region based on my own country. As with all fanfic regions comes fakemon, and I'm currently building the pseudo legendary of the region. I like the convergent evolution idea that was introduced (at least I think it was first introduced) in Scarlet and Violet with toedscool and wiglett.

As such I created a convergent line of pokemon based on Aegislash since (let's be real) there's too many dragon pseudo legendaries. This version of Aegislash is Steel/Water with an ability that makes it raise its crit ratio by 1 each time it gets hit, rather than stance change. Since this is my first time creating a pokemon aside from its design, I was wondering if its base stats are OP or not.

HP: 127 ATK: 140 DEF: 130 SPA: 60 SPD: 130 SPE: 13 BST: 600

I've used Pokemon Showdown's damage calculator using a water type sacred sword with a life orb, with max EVs in HP and ATK. I found that it OHKOs a lot of pokemon if it crits (Found out that Kommo-o is damn tanky), which it probably will with the ability. Obviously this isn't going to appear in any fangames or anything but I like the idea of the battles in my story being concluded with actual calculations and wanted to know those who are experts in competitive play.

Btw, I haven't played competitively since ORAS and Scarlet and Violet has me having fun and just following some content creators suggestions rather than finding things out on my own for the mean time.",2022-12-15 17:59:58

[S/V] Best Pokemon for Tera Raid by Type - Water,3,zmmvsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zmmvsc/sv_best_pokemon_for_tera_raid_by_type_water/,0,1671115753.0,"**Introduction**

Here is the guide for Water in the series. As always, you want to pick it into where your moves do super effective damage and their moves your typing resists.

**Typing**

Water is offensively good against Ground/Rock/Fire

Water is defensively strong against Fire/Water/Ice/Steel

Water is defensively weak against Electric/Grass

**Methodology**

A lot of Pokemon could work, but I mostly looked for Pokemon with:

* High Base Stats for their typing
* High Attacking/Special Attacking Stats for their typing
* Access to Self Healing
* Access to Self Stat Boosts/Debuffs

**Notes**

Azumarill boxes out pretty much every other Water Physical Type because in most cases you should always pick it over the next best option. For Special Attackers, there is a couple options that have access to large buffs and healing.

**I would say that currently, Azumarill is the best Water Type for Physical, and Vaporeon the best Water Type for Special. I think Slowbro/Slowking is a good other option for Special Attackers.**

Let me know if you have any Pokemon you think would be good or any suggestions for the below builds. I'll do Electric tomorrow.

Below are the builds.

* All Physical Attackers are Adamant Nature with 252 HP/ 252 Atk EV Spread and All Special Attackers are Modest Nature with 252 HP/252 SpAtk.
* Bold are the moves I think it has to have, while non-bold are other options.
* All Tera Types will be Water for the extra STAB.
* These are primarily focused on Solo Sessions but the moves can be switched up for Online

**Builds**

*Azumarill - Physical Attacker - Huge Power*

\- Possible Moves: **Liquidation, Belly Drum,** Rain Dance, Aqua Ring, Play Rough

\- Possible Items: Sitrus Berry, Shell Bell

\- Strategy: Sitrus Berry helps you survive after Belly Drum but if you aren't afraid of getting hit for 50% after you Belly Drum you can run Shell Bell for Self Healing. You want to try to keep Belly Drum up then Liquidation otherwise

*Vaporeon - Special Attacker - Hydration*

\- Possible Moves: **Surf, Rain Dance, Rest,** Calm Mind, Fake Tears

\- Possible Items: Damp Rock, Mystical Water

\- Strategy: Rain Dance + Rest keeps you health, Calm Mind buffs you up and Surf is your main damage dealer. Try to keep Rain Dance up, Rest if low, keep 1-2 Calm Mind stacks up and Surf Otherwise.

*Slowbro/Slowking - Special Attacker - Oblivious*

\- Possible Moves: **Surf, Slack Off, Calm Mind/Nasty Plot, Psychic**

\- I did Slowbro because I didn't have to trade it to get Slowking, but I think Slowking is better because Calm Mind will buff your Sp Def too. I think you can choose either one.

\- You slack off if you're low, keep 1 to 2 stacks of Nasty Plot of Calm Mind up and Surf for damage

*Clawitzer - Special Attacker - Mega Launcher*

\- Possible Moves: **Water Pulse,** Aura Sphere, Dragon Pulse, Dark Pulse

\- Possible Items: Choice Specs

\- You do a lot of damage but no healing, so I'd only pick this when it resists the pokemon's moves.

*Tatsugiri - Special Attacker - Storm Drain*

\- Possible Moves: **Nasty Plot, Surf,** Taunt, Rain Dance, Dragon Pulse, Helping Hand

\- Strategy: A good counter to Water Type Pokemon but very niche, I wouldn't recommend building it unless you want Tatsugiri to work.

*Quaquaval - Physical Attacker - Torrent*

\- Possible Moves: **Liquidation, Swords Dance,** Close Combat, Wave Crash (Finisher)

\- Possible Items: Shell Bell, Leftovers

\- I think Azumarill is better, but this is an option

*Gyarados - Physical Attacker - Intimidate*

\- Possible Moves: **Waterfall, Dragon Dance,** Thunder Wave

\- Possible Items: Shell Bell, Leftovers

\- I think Azumarill is better, but this is an option

**Future Home Pokemon**

\- Kyogre (Calm Mind, Water Spout) will be the best Special Attacker for Water. Palkia seems like a worse Kyogre. Physical Attackers still boxed out by Azumarill.

looks pretty cool right? that's one hell of an interesting design for a legendary pokémon. big crystal hexagon orb thing. but the text missing a bunch of characters. why would that be? the assumption is that the page was damaged, and part of the text was lost, right? but what if it's something else? i decided to put the hidden letters back again:

i'm not amazing at this sort of thing, so i wanted to put it in the hands of the community and see if anything else is here to be discovered. because it might just be a coincidence, but it MIGHT have a cool hidden easter egg. what if there is more to be found here?



**""why would there be a hidden message in the scarlet book""?** reading the book itself, Heath describes an incident where he was separated from the rest of his group. he temporarily fell into a dream-like state, and he has no memory of what happened while he blacked out. when he woke up however he was holding a piece of paper with drawings of hexagons on it - all was written in his own handwriting. 

it seems that his subconscious was trying to send a message to his waking self - to inform himself of what he was seeing and experiencing, since he knew there was a chance he would forget. what if he is still trying to send messages about what he saw in another way? when he later went on to write the scarlet / violet book, he might have (either knowingly or unknowingly) included further messages, trying to send a message to himself or others about what he saw.

the paldea crater has a HUGE amount of mystery, and there are loads of dangling plot threads awaiting follow up. would be rad if something was teased like this. on the other hand, it might all be a coincidence! but for people who like finding hidden messages, there is maybe something here to find.",2022-12-15 13:36:20

Looking to do a 251 glitchless speedrun for the first two generations. Any tips?,2,znb4s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/znb4s6/looking_to_do_a_251_glitchless_speedrun_for_the/,3,1671184725.0,"The idea is simple:  My objective is to obtain all 151 Pokemon in each of the Gen 1 games, as well as all 251 Pokemon in each of the Gen 2 games.  I'm not allowed to use any major glitches to sequence break or to obtain additional Pokemon, aside from Mew.  In other words, playing these six games as honestly as possible.  More to the point, I can only play Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal.

So I'm looking to brainstorm some ideas.  One idea I really like is concentrating my efforts on leveling up as few Pokemon in each game as possible.  A good chunk of the Gen 1 Pokemon that need evolving can be caught in the wild in the Gen 2 games, and even a decent number of that chunk are available in Pokemon Yellow.  So if you take all of that into consideration, the following Pokemon must be evolved via level up in the first two generations of Pokemon:  Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmeleon, Charizard, Wartortle, Blastoise, Pidgeot, Omastar, Kabutops, Dragonite, Bayleef, Meganium, Quilava, Typhlosion, Croconaw, Feraligatr, Crobat\*, Togetic\*, Xatu, Ampharos, Azumarill, Jumpluff, Espeon\*, Umbreon\*, Forretress, Magcargo, Piloswine, Octillery, Houndoom, Hitmontop, Blissey\*, Pupitar, and Tyrannitar.  If I missed someone, it's because they're available somewhere in the wild in either Gen's 1 or 2.

Each Gen 1 game only really has four Pokemon families to grind up, while Gen 2 exclusively has 17 evolutionary lines (counting both Eeveelutions seperately).  Of those 17, at least 6 of these aren't going to be a problem at all, as Golbat and Togepi are both ready to evolve via max happiness, and Natu, Marill, Remeraid, and Houndour are all about a level or so away from evolving.  Oddly enough, Ampharos and Octillery are the only ones from the above list that can't be caught in Pokemon Crystal, which means I need to make plans for such contingencies.  Otherwise, the objective is to simply catch any and all Pokemon that I run into in each game, only working on the Pokemon that need to evolve whenever necessary.

Any tips would be appreciated.  Thanks.",2022-12-16 11:58:45

Basically i was reading pokedex entries, especially Ghost type ones, and that's what is said for Chandelure:

""The spirits burned up in its ominous flame lose their way and wander this world forever.""

You see where I'm going probably.
Now, I'm not saying that he created every Ghost Pokémon, but take for example Phantump.

A lost kid ends up dying in a forest. MMMMHH, weird. You know, there's a Pokémon (Litwick) that pretends to help you when you get losts and then kills you,or at least your body.
Now, we know that only Chandelure leaves souls wander the world, most ghost type Pokémon eat them.
And about Litwick and Lumpant, if Chandelure does not really eat souls, why Litwick and Lumpant should?

The only problem here is that most ghost type Pokémon are pre-Gen V. But that's obviously because the Chandelure line didn't exists yet. So it's not really a point",2022-12-16 11:57:09

"All the battle gimmicks that aren't mega evolution need to come back in future games, and we need another game without them.",0,zn9vpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zn9vpm/all_the_battle_gimmicks_that_arent_mega_evolution/,2,1671179420.0,"Mega evolution needs to return eventually too but I've developed the same love for each of these as I have mega evolution. All the exclusive z-moves had super badass animations including light that burns the sky which is my favorite move of all time, and I hate the thought I might never see it in another game. G-max moves didn't spark the same awe but they weren't all very unique if at all in their animation. Though little is more memorable to me than the time I first saw g-max cannonade. And I just thought dynamax was a fun mechanic. And terastallization is also super fun.

But we also need another main series game without them because battle gimmicks are getting stale. They were a fun way to keep the series fresh for a bit but they're getting less and less practical. Mega evolution could have possibly been a main stay because it was very selective in the pokemon it powered up and that limited the number of pokemon that would become problematic quite a bit compared to the other mechanics.  It still caused controversey. Without a doubt mega evolution created monsters, though the amount created is incomparable to any of the other mechanics. Z-moves required an item so comprimised had to be made and you could scout for it. But it powered up numerously more pokemon than mega evolution and was arguably more controversial. Dynamax is where it got out of control because it didn't require an item so anyone on your team could dynamax. On top of that the pokemon's moves got boosted for 3 turns instead of 1, all the attacking moves had secondary effects and your pokemon got double HP. It's an intensely controversial mechanic. And I'm afraid to say terastallization might be more overpowered than any of them. It's like having a z-move for every turn for the rest of the game but it's more broken than that. Switching your type is like switching pokemon out in a way. You can terastallize to resist an attacik. But if you switch, you lose a turn. You run the risk of your opponent predicting your terastallization but it's nowhere near as devastating as predicting a switch in a lot of the time because you don't lose your turn.

More so, I don't know where it goes from changing your type. It's the most conceivably insane mechanic I could think to add to pokemon. But it's impossible for everyone to enjoy these mechanics and they only seem to get more and more controversial at least in competitive communities. I don't think it's realistic to keep this generational battle mechanic thing up.

And finally, I need gamefreak to show they remember the world without mega evolution exists. Zinnia said don't destroy the world without mega evolution. Though the games with dynamax and terastallization don't have mega evolution the mechanics are related.",2022-12-16 10:30:20

"How to (maybe) restore / fix a corrupted Pokemon HeartGold / SoulSilver save file (might work for Platinum, Diamond, Pearl and others*)",2,zn8ww1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zn8ww1/how_to_maybe_restore_fix_a_corrupted_pokemon/,0,1671175427.0,"Even though they're older games they're still one of my favorites by far, so here comes my little journey.

Upon starting my HG today I was informed that the save file has been corrupted/""deleted""; panicking and browsing the internet for fixes I managed to restore my corrupted save file.

Depending on whether you're using a cartridge or are emulating you can simply skip most steps.

To do this you'll firstly need a HGSS game that's been corrupted (achievable by any means) and a modded DSi/3DS with GodMode9 (or GodMode9i).

After that you'll need to launch into GodMode9 (holding start while turning on the DS), go to the ""\[C:\] GAMECART"" drive, select the .sav file and copy it to ""0:/gm9/out""

Having done that you'll need to copy the file from your SD card to a computer and open the .sav file in PKHeX and just export the .sav again without changing anything.

Chances are that this will fix whatever was corrupted; if you can't open the .sav file in PKHeX then this will sadly not work for you.

Doing this and replacing the new save file is basically all you'd have to do, if you're using an emulator.

Then just copy the newly exported .sav file back onto the SD card to whatever folder you prefer, I chose the gm9/in folder, and reinsert the SD card into the DS.

Launch back into GodMode9:

Using GodMode9i: Browse to the .sav file on the SD card, press A, and choose ""Restore save""

Using GodMode9: Browse to the .sav file and press Y to copy it, then back out and select the ""\[C:\] GAMECART"" drive, select the .sav file in there and choose ""Inject data (at)offset"", and press A for 0.

You might have to allow GodMode9 to write to the cartridge, wait until it's done and after that you can just lock the writing permissions again.

This seems to have done the trick for quite a few people out there, including me, so best of luck to you, that it'll also fix your save file.

\*might work, haven't tested anything but HGSS though.

Just a little venting about Scarlet/Violet,25,zn8qt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zn8qt6/just_a_little_venting_about_scarletviolet/,4,1671174744.0,"So I’m moderately Red/Green colorblind, I can see them but sometimes I have difficulty seeing them properly. Case in point, I work in a group home and sometimes I am assigned to the kitchen. So I always ask others to check that any meat I cook is cooked properly, because food poisoning is no joke.

With that bit of context out of the way, the fact that there is no indication that a Pokémon is shiny beyond the model frustrates me. Legends Arceus handled shinies better, there was a sound to signify one was near and they sparkled. To my knowledge, the only shiny I have seen was a Kirlia that immediately used teleport. But the fact that I might be missing out bothers me, because dammit, I want to shiny hunt too!

Edit: I also have trouble sometimes with colors that are composed of either red and/or green. So I don’t only struggle with red and green, it’s all colors that include them.",2022-12-16 09:12:24

That is not what I am getting at here though. This is just as stupid though. I am moving my living dex from US/UM to Home. I don't have a complete one but I am working on a form dex as well. I spent all the time in US/UM collecting all the stupidass stickers so I could have a complete set of Totem Pokemon. What I was not aware of is that once you move them to Home, THEY JUST GO AWAY!!! As in, they just turn into regular Pokemon. It started out with me trying to figure out why one of my Totem Pokemon couldn't be moved into Bank and apparently, sometimes the friggin software just reads a Totem Pokemon as being a clone/hack. Well that is just fuggin great. Now I don't have the full set... I even considered restarting US (since all my stuff is in UM) and collecting stickers since it was one of the lower level number of sticker Totems. That is when I see that once they go from Bank to Home, it doesn't matter anyway. Great. Right after I just get finished transferring them all over to Home. 

At this point, what the hell is the point of the National Dex? We can't complete it in game anymore and special Pokemon from past gens are just wiped out. I know it's been stated before but this is just further proof that Pokemon has basically gotten rid of it's initial selling point of ""Gotta Catch 'em All"". You physically can't anymore. 

I have been playing since Gen one and, if you would have told me, 25+ years later I wouldn't be able to use my Pokemon in game anymore I would have laughed at you. Dex completion is the part of the game that kept me coming back. If I can't do that, I really don't have a desire to play anymore. Guess it's about time for me to move on.",2022-12-16 09:07:53

Raid Power Time Penalty,2,zn8j0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zn8j0h/raid_power_time_penalty/,0,1671173926.0,"TL;DR: I had Raid Power 2 going for a 6star raid and when my Mon fainted, I didn’t receive a time penalty. Is that always the case when using Raid Powers?

So my 6 star raid for the day was a Tera flying Dondozo. Recent videos out there have shown that Dondozo is one of the 6 Mons that have high Herba Mystica drops, so I whipped up a Flying Raid Power 2 samich to increase the drops. While doing the raid, my Mon fainted. Nbd because I had plenty of time so I wasn’t fearing the penalty. But as I waited the 5 seconds for my Mon to come back, I noticed the timer didn’t lose anything. It was ticking down like normal. I just accepted this, won the battle and got my rewards. 

Since I still had time left with the sammich, I looked around for other flying Tera raids. Luckily for me there was one and it was a 5 star Mudsdale. I entered the fight and again, my Mon fainted and once again there was no time penalty like before. Just the 5 sec cooldown. 

Maybe my game bugged out and wasn’t registering the time penalty because that can’t be a coincidence that both Flying raids ignored the time penalty when my Mon fainted. Or do Raid powers stop the time penalty from taking place? Did I just never know about it or have never seen a video that mentions it?",2022-12-16 08:58:46

**121 - Starmie**

Hey, it's another instance of fanart so good that it's making me question my actual ranking of this Pokémon! Almost. In all honesty though, I like Starmie. Sure, it's just a ten armed purple starfish instead of a five armed orange starfish, but the progression is pretty clear in it's design - it's hard to really say there was any potential in Staryu to capitalize on that this thing didn't hit. It has a more powerful seeming color palette, it's bigger, and it has more arms, and... you really can't ask for much more from Staryu.

But at the same time, I can't in good conscious rank it very high for all the reasons Staryu failed to interest me - it still feels like just a starfish. Nothing about it's depiction in the games or Pokedex caught my attention in anyway, nor does it's design stand out to me. Amongst a myriad of aquatic creatures made into water type, only the extremely loosely justified psychic typing makes it stand out to me. It ranks just one stage above Staryu in the **C- Tier,** same as the last one.

Oh! There is one memorable thing about Starmie, in that it's Misty's ace Pokémon. Sadly, it didn't make quite as big an impression as Onix did as Brock's ace, as Onix was a memorable first boss, whereas Starmie doesn't have the same degree of presence to it. I generally try to talk about trainers aces if they play a memorable role in the games, but I probably won't catch all of them. I know I've definitely already missed a few.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, I'm not late this time, technically, woo! Anyway, leave a comment telling me what you think of Starmie, I love hearing your thoughts, and hopefully I'll see you tomorrow!

The tune was subtle but the original melody came in. Went to Viridian forest and the first encounter was a Pikachu. Got to Pewter and the same people were there. The Old man was still fond of his radio, the kid that got scammed off of money for a Magikarp now loved his Gyarados, the Museum was as it was the first time I visited. Brock was mature self just like Misty was herself in Cerulean Gym. Route 1 the same pleasant path as it was, and Pallet Town the peacekeeper that it has always been. Meganium all grown up from being a Chikorita being right beside me.

More than 18 years ago when I played Pokémon Leaf Green for the first time, I felt something, and this just hit exactly like that same feeling today. I thought I'd never feel like this ever again even with another Pokémon game but I am. Pokémon HeartGold is my newest, most favourite and the best Pokémon game ever. This is the same world and the same home that had me get lost in it the first time I got to play Pokémon, the same place that I saw on TV where Ash started his journey.

I love Pokémon man. Really hope this same magic feeling gets inherited in future Pokémon titles.",2022-12-16 07:21:33

The Many Pros & Cons Of Scarlet & Violet,7,zn3i8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zn3i8z/the_many_pros_cons_of_scarlet_violet/,13,1671157155.0,"So, *Scarlet* and *Violet* have been with us for roughly a month now, and I've definitely put enough time into it to have a somewhat educated opinion on the games, and I figured this might help out people who are still unsure if they want to play them or not. There are some minor spoilers here, but I do feel they are important points to consider.

Pros:

* Really good writing - potentially the best plot since gen 5 with actually good twists.
* Likeable characters, and I don't mean ones we're meant to like but become stale and annoying, I mean actually likeable.
* Amazing new Pokémon designs.
* Terastalization is actually a fun gimmick. Gen 9 competitive should be very interesting.
* Region is fun to explore.
* Box mascots are easily the most involved in a plot that they have ever been.
* The Paldea region is pretty nice.
* Open world exploration.
* Three story paths, with a final story arc once all three are finished.
* Phenomenal OST.
* Overworld shinies often have built in fail-safes to avoid failure before you encounter them, such as Voltorb not exploding and Sudowoodo running away much slower when shiny.
* The most scope any game of the franchise has had to date.

Cons:

* Performance (at the time of writing this) is atrociously bad. It stutters, it lags, it occasionally freezes, the lakes really grind things to a halt, Pokémon spawn in walls and floors, raids lag and have a lot of issues online... The performance is definitely the biggest drawback to these titles.
* Buggy combat - several abilities and secondary effects do not trigger (at the time of writing, I am not aware of this being fixed). These include Huge Power and Knock Off.
* Very little post-game content thus far, although they have definitely set up for DLC content.
* You cannot rematch the league once you have earned the title of champion. You can still get the Paldea Champion Ribbon via a post-game tournament at the academy that you can redo, but the Elite Four and champion fights are one and done.
* Still no return of every Pokémon being able to be used, but I think we already knew that this would be a permanent change.
* Not the best, graphically, especially with such poor optimisation and performance.
* The large scope can work against the game, causing many of the prior issues I have mentioned.
* No level scaling,  so despite the open exploration, there is still a recommended order to do things in.

A few extra bits of info that may be important:

* Shinies appear in the overworld.
* Shinies neither sparkle, nor make a noise until encountered in battle.
* Shiny Charm is back.
* Shiny odds can be boosted via different means, including by making sandwiches and the return of Masuda.
* No daycare - eggs are now obtained via picnics.

Personally, I'm really enjoying gen 9, despite its issues, though I do hope the DLC adds a lot of content, and I hope they fix the glaring issues the game has. They definitely need to work on the competitive issues, as moves and abilities not working as intended are obviously problematic. I am having way more fun than I did with *Sword* and *Shield* though.",2022-12-16 04:19:15

Paldea does feel kinda dead sometimes...,10,zn1nx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zn1nx1/paldea_does_feel_kinda_dead_sometimes/,5,1671151667.0,"After finishing my living dex I've been knocking a ton of 6* raids solo, then I got tired of them and started wandering the world.

There is this idea stuck in my head, and I can't help but compare it, this video I remember watching many years ago, ""101 things to do in Los Santos"". In Paldea, I can't bring the count to 5.

The graphics don't help either. I feel like if the game was a bit prettier just exploring the wild would fill in the blanks, but the towns have nothing to them.

How Has Your Taste in Pokémon Changed Over the Years?,8,zn0v5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zn0v5p/how_has_your_taste_in_pokémon_changed_over_the/,49,1671149449.0,"Aesthetically, or by gameplay, or even through sentimental value, how have your tastes in Pokémon changed over your lifetime? I’ll start:

When I was a kid, my first Pokémon games were FireRed and Sapphire. This was peak “big monsters are cool” phase of my life so Pokémon like Nidoking, Rhyhorn, Aggron, and even Armaldo of all Pokémon were my faves. I loved the steel and rock types and those other bestial looking Pokémon were my bread and butter. Furthermore, Pokémon that took too long to evolve like most pseudo-legendaries I stayed away from and at most I only had one legendary each game because I used up my master ball and didn’t have the cognitive abilities as a child to strategize how to catch legendaries without it.

When I got older around the time BW and BW2 came out, I was in the last few years of elementary school and entering high school. These were my contrarian, edgy, and hipster years (I also had an Action Replay DSi in the back pocket). On an aside before I delve into those games more, I believe the Gen 4 Sinnoh games were my least favourite — even though HGSS are some of my faves of that gen — in due in part to how popular they were but how slow and plodding I found them. Using my Action Replay, I beat all the gym leaders and elite four by catching their Pokémon and ending the battles early. In a way, I ruined the experience for myself in those games. I really liked Luxray though at the time.

When I got BW and BW2 I was fond of all the lesser used and oddball Pokémon. Heck, I chose Archeops over Carracosta, and honestly, you’re handicapping yourself by doing so, sadly. They ought to give Archeops Zero to Hero instead of Defeatist now. Heatmor, Durant, Beheeyem, Druddigon and Golurk, were my faves around this time but I also didn’t shy away from using Legendaries, and thus enjoying them more as I matured and got smarter at playing these games.

Nowadays, I find all sorts of Pokémon charming but have noticed myself slowly edging away from traditionally cool Pokémon to ones that’d balance my team better, fulfill a role, or are cute. Primarina ended up being my favourite starter ever, and that SM team of Golisopod, Mudsdale, Primarina, Tsareena, Solgaleo, and Ribombee was a major threat in my eyes and probably the best team I ever put together. Then I booted up USUM and saw my team had a Hypno and Lopunny on it and cringed.

I don’t know what Pokémon will appeal to me when I get SV one day but it’s interesting in hindsight to see which Pokémon I favoured through the years and to note and consistencies and inconsistencies. It really shows how far I’ve come and how I’ve developed as a Trainer.

Now how about you?

 Next I think he would have a Stantler and a Sawsbuck (specifically the Winter form). 

I also think he would have an Abomasnow as a reference to a Christmas tree.

 I think he would also have a Cryogonal as it's the most ice type of the ice types to me and snow is so heavily associated with Christmas. 

And last I would give him a Baltoy as a reference to him giving toys because Baltoy is based on tops and other balancing toys and because the other toy Pokemon Banette doesn't exactly seem kid friendly.

some people say that it is in reverse, pokemon are getting extinct, no. Here's what i think:

Technology is advancing,  pokeballs are getting more and more capable of capturing what were otherwise normal animals in the world, its not that there were only 150 pokemon back then,  its just that we were only capable of capturing those with the technology available, there's billions of poke dollars in research across the whole saga, several companies and labs working hard to make sure new species are being able to be captured and trained thanks to that.  add to that the current regional availability, not all regions will have every pokemon.

In my opinion, **any of the stuff that is tertiary and mostly separate from the lore of the Pokémon themselves.** In other words aspects of the setting and lore that are either unexplained or under-explained (you have to read books or Pokédex entries or official external material to learn this stuff)

Now I will admit my definition is kind of weak (feel free to come up with a better definition). To illustrate my point here are some examples of what I am talking about:


* aliens being real and some Pokémon are aliens ex Elgyem and Beheeyem, clefairy, and of course Deoxys

* inter/extra dimensional Pokémon ex Ultra-beasts, Unown (possibly), and Arceus

* Time travel, Celebi, Arceus, >!area zero and the new professors in Scarlet and Violet!<

* artificial Pokémon: Porygon 

* Cloning: mewtwo 

Like these things are so under explained and under explored. Like yes some movies and tv episodes and specials have touched on these but the reason I say they are under explained is even in the shows and games that directly reference them, it’s typically under explained. Take the first Pokémon movie, the antagonist (Mewtwo) and his minions are all clones. Now I am not expecting a deep sci-fi jargon explanation of the cloning process but other than the first 15 minutes the movie just rushes past the fact mewtwo is a clone. Like the revelation Mewtwo was cloned and had advanced cloning tech should have been a little bit more shocking to Ash and company. Like it was basically ignored. I get it the franchise is for kids and perhaps remaining mysterious is for the best.

And yes I know on the time travel bit people will point out the 4th Pokémon movie and legend of Arceus but these pieces of media are similar to the first Pokémon movie in that it is mentioned and happens but this fact isn’t touched upon after the first 15 minutes. Like time travel should be a much bigger deal.

Getting back on topic, I find the little breadcrumbs of lore so interesting. Like I wanna know how all these things connect. Some legendaries like Arceus bridge these gaps but many others have yet had their place in the lore explained. 

Like if Eternatus came from space and his defeat is why Dynamax exists in Galar how does this relate to Deoxys, it’s Crystal, and ability to mega evolve (yes I agree it’s sad GameFreak won’t bring this back).

Again I know Pokémon is for kids and we probably won’t ever get deeper explanations but it would still be cool if these ideas could be more fleshed out and ideally compiled so we could know more about them and how they relate",2022-12-15 21:17:26

"Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I think Sword/Shield was way better than Scarlet/Violet",0,zmtcs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zmtcs0/maybe_an_unpopular_opinion_but_i_think/,7,1671131630.0,"I finished Scarlet a few weeks ago and decided to play Sword for the first time afterward. I just finished it and I gotta say, I had way more fun with Sword than Scarlet. I'll break it down into little pieces here. (Spoilers for Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet ahead)

Gyms/Elite 4 - winner: Sword

The gym experience was just so much more fun in these games. The challenges were fun AND you got to battle trainers in the process. I hated how they handled gyms in S/V, and the trainer battles that were part of them felt too forced. The way all of the matches were watched by crowds and felt like a big deal made them a lot more fun too. Also, I liked Leon a hell of a lot more than Geeta.

Playing experience - winner: Sword

S/V are riddled with bugs/glitches. It didn't bother me too much on my playthrough at first, but playing Sword made me realize how much more enjoyable the game is when it runs smoothly. Bugs and glitches aside, I feel like Sword actually felt like a true pokemon game whereas Scarlet just felt like a game with pokemon (not sure if that makes sense).

New Pokemon - winner: Sword

There are definitely some cool new pokemon in S/V, but Sw/Sh had some awesome choices. The Galarian forms of old pokemon were some of my favorites, including obstagoon, sirfetchd, and rapidash. Also dragapult is one of my favorite pseudo-legendaries now.

Starters - winner: tie

Honestly, not a huge fan of the starters from either region. For Sw/Sh, all the starters are kinda unremarkable, and the starters from S/V are just... odd. Not a huge fan of the starters having some kinda theme to them.

Plot/Storyline - winner: Scarlet

The plot in S/V was pretty awesome - especially Area Zero. The plot in Sw/Sh is pretty solid, but the climax was definitely underwhelming. If S/V release DLC based around Area Zero, I'll be so happy.

New battle gimmick - winner: tie

I'm not sure what the general consensus was on terastillizing vs gigantimaxing, but I thought they were both fun. I'll forever be salty that they took away mega evolutions though.

Postgame (not including Area Zero storyline as part of the postgame) - winner: Sword

The fact that Sw/Sh have a battle tower automatically makes the postgame better imo. There's lots of new space to explore with the DLC as well (fingers crossed we get some good S/V DLC), ~~plus there's more than only a handful of legendary pokemon to catch. Catching the legendaries in S/V was very underwhelming.~~ as stefyB pointed out, most of the legendaries in SwSh are DLC only. I still believe postgame Sw/Sh is better, though.

'Raid' battles - winner: Sword

The max raid battles in Sword flow a lot better compared to the terra raid battles in Scarlet. The timer in Scarlet drives me crazy since it takes forever for your turn to happen, and I like the rewards a lot more.

Difficulty - winner: Sword

Neither game was particularly difficult, but I definitely felt like my Pokemon were a closer in level with Sword than Scarlet. Obviously the open world of Scarlet plays into this a lot (which I think was a bad choice), but even trying to follow a specific pattern in Scarlet, I felt like my Pokemon were too easily overpowered.

Anyway, I just felt like I had to put this out there. I was really hesitant to play Sw/Sh, but I had a lot more fun playing it than I did with Scarlet.",2022-12-15 21:13:50
Anyone else feel like egg hatching is not as fun S/V?,9,zmtcla,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zmtcla/anyone_else_feel_like_egg_hatching_is_not_as_fun/,25,1671131617.0,"My first time egg hatching was in Sw/Sh and i absolutely loved shiny hunting that way for some reason. Spinning in circles in front of the hatchery while my eggs hatched was fun to me. But in S/V it feels like it takes way longer to achieve the same amount of work. Even with egg power 2 I get a little over a box of eggs in 30 minutes, and then I have to leave the picnic to hatch all of them which adds even more time. Another thing is the fact that I need to make a sandwich every 30 minutes to keep the speed of egg laying, which ends of being still slower than the speed you could achieve in Sw/Sh naturally. I’m not trying to complain too much since it’s still a really fun game but shiny hunting through eggs was my endgame content before and now it just doesn’t feel fun at all? Anyone else agree or have tips to make it faster/more enjoyable? Thanks for reading!",2022-12-15 21:13:37

Regigigas should have never been given Slow Start.,9,zmsvma,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zmsvma/regigigas_should_have_never_been_given_slow_start/,8,1671130450.0,"Were they worried it would've been the strongest pokemon during the Gen 4 era if they didn't give it Slow Start? Were they worried it would've been ""too overpowered""?

Honestly, I doubt it would've. Competitively, I doubt it would've been better than Arceus or even Mewtwo. It would have been Uber for sure though - or at the absolute least, top of OU.

It's the king for three other legendaries. Anyone that sees Regigigas for the first time and learns about its lore and how its the king for three other legendaries would've expected it to be extremely strong before they learn about Slow Start.

I can understand Slaking having Truant, because that thing is not meant to be a legendary and it would've been absurdly busted without it. ~~Also, Truant is not nearly as bad as Slow Start. Slaking at least gets to use its full power in every time that it does get to attack, so it's definitely much better than Regigigas.~~ Regigigas on the other hand IS a legendary, it SHOULD be insanely strong. I don't think it would have been the best pokemon during Gen 4 era if it didn't have Slow Start, if that's what GameFreak was worried about enough to give it that ability. Definitely not nowadays due to power creep.

Did GameFreak just think that base attack being 160 or more was ""too overpowered"" during the Gen 4 era and needed a huge downside to ""balance"" it? Is that why they neutered Rampardos by making all its other stats shit? I mean, Regigigas still has the same BST as Groudon, only just having a bit more attack but is physically frailer. Regigigas also doesn't exactly have a crazy diverse movepool (Slaking got quite a juicy one though).",2022-12-15 20:54:10

Why so many people prefer the Scarlet Paradoxes over the Violet Paradoxes,75,zmsphw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zmsphw/why_so_many_people_prefer_the_scarlet_paradoxes/,138,1671130022.0,"So, I’m fairly confident in asserting that the Past Paradox Pokémon are favored over the Future Paradox Pokémon by the majority of the fan base. This provokes a question in the minds of many, no doubt: “Why?” I think my somewhat limited experience in the area of character design might have come up with the answer.

So, barring the personal factors that vary between individuals (preferences for the aesthetic, bias towards the original Pokémon, inclination towards objective competitive viability, etc.), why do people prefer the Scarlet Paradoxes over Violet Paradoxes? The answer’s actually quite simple: it’s their silhouettes. 

The Scarlet Paradox Pokémon all have very distinct silhouettes compared to the Pokémon they’re based on, each and every one having *something* that’s makes them stand out compared to their original. However, many of the Violet Paradox Pokémon have silhouettes that are incredibly similar to their originals’. Thus, no matter how much has actually changed, our minds interpret them as at least a bit more as (essentially) a recolor or skin of the original, rather than something new with great inspiration taken from the original. Iron Jugulis, Thorns, and Hands are especially guilty of this.

So, in the future, is there a way to make the Future Paradox ‘mon distinguish their silhouettes from their originals, without changing their design? Well, sort of; changing their posture would help, but by how much is uncertain.

I’d like to remind everyone that I am no authority on the subject of character design or social analysis. I’m merely someone partway through a Design class and who draws in their free time. I could be remembering stuff wrong, or have an incomplete understanding of the relevant concepts.",2022-12-15 20:47:02

Gengar is tanky, Jellicent’s water type gives her access to some Ice moves as well. Throwing in a fairy ghost should help prevent wiping with dark moves and help counter that. Ceruledge is just amazing and it was hard to pick between him and Skeledirge or even Chandalure. If we were including Arceus then I would have Zoroark in there probably instead of maybe Gengar?

**What if you are visually impaired and have difficulty discerning certain colors from one another? I looked in the options menu and there are no color blind settings**. So not only are there no audio cues for people who are visually impaired, there are no color blind settings either! 


**In fact, half the shinies that are in the game are not even visible anymore because they didn't keep the sparkle and audio noise that Arceus had**, which was honestly a very brilliant implementation in every single way. You could easily tell what was a shiny and what wasn't especially during an outbreak. Now? There's no way to tell. Some Pokémon like Espeon are incredibly obvious because there's a green cat running around with a bunch of pink ones, you obviously would be able to see them immediately. Other ones like tandemaus Have literally nothing different about it other than a small tuft of hair on its chest. It's almost impossible to see it. Gible has the same issue, almost entirely difficult to even see that it's shiny at all.

But there are a lot of parallels between the last part of Scarlet and Violet's campaign in Area Zero, and the Zero Escape trilogy, particularly the third game.

You have:

A robot that looks and acts like a human. It even seems to have human emotions, but has to follow orders.

Child endangerment.

A room that looks and is like the quantum computer room.

Villains motivated by some world-ending threat (the virus and the paradox pokemon).

Since I find it boring to use the Belly Drum strategy that everyone and their mother is bringing these days, I've been switching between these builds to mix things up.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ceruledge

Ability: Flash Fire

Item: Charcoal

Tera Type: Fire

Nature: Adamant

EVs: 252 HP, 252 Attack

Moves:

Swords Dance

Bitter Blade

Clear Smog

(doesn’t matter)

&#x200B;

This is IMO one of the best offensive builds alongside Iron Hands. You can't max attack as quickly as Belly Drum can, but Swords Dance is still pretty decent. Bitter Blade provides strong STAB that also heals you. Not sure what the optimal item should be, but have been using Charcoal just to buff Bitter Blade. Clear Smog is there to remove enemy buffs if they get too crazy. I think I have Light Screen in the last slot, but realistically you never click it. Just spam Bitter Blade until you can tera.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Armorouge

Ability: Flash Fire

Item: Light Clay

Tera Type: Fire

Nature: Bold

EVs: 252 Defense, 252 Special Attack/HP

Moves:

Reflect

Clear Smog

Will-o-wisp

Flamethrower/Helping Hand

&#x200B;

This is a defensive set that takes advantage of Armorouge's awesome move pool. Reflect and Light Clay reduce damage to the team, Clear Smog keep setup moves/abilities in check, and Will-o-wisp further neuters strong attackers. The build I use has some offensive capabilities with max special attack and Flamethrower for STAB, but you could go with a more purely supportive build with Helping Hand and max HP if you want. You could also probably do well using max special defense and Light Screen instead.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Grimmsnarl

Ability: Prankster

Item: Light Clay

Tera Type: Fairy

Nature: Careful

EVs: 252 HP, 252 Special Defense

Moves:

Spirit Break

Light Screen

Fake Tears

Misty Terrain/Taunt

&#x200B;

The best special support mon IMO. Light Screen + Light Clay to reduce damage, Spirit Break to reduce special attack even if the raid boss has its shield up. Fake Tears helps special attackers on your team do more damage. Misty Terrain is great for preventing status conditions. Taunt can also help with this while also preventing you from getting Taunted yourself.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Umbreon

Ability: Synchronize

Item: Light Clay

Tera Type: doesn’t matter

Nature: Bold

EVs: 252 HP, 252 Defense

Moves:

Reflect

Helping Hand

Taunt

Charm

&#x200B;

Probably the best physical defense support. Reflect and Charm greatly reduce damage to the team, while Helping Hand buffs your best attacker. Taunt is mainly to prevent yourself from being Taunted and becoming useless. I originally had Moonlight, but found that I rarely took enough damage to need it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Chansey/Blissey

Ability: Healer

Item: Eviolite/Light Clay

Tera Type: doesn’t matter

Nature: Calm

EVs: 252 HP, 252 Special Defense

Moves:

Light Screen

Helping Hand

Heal Pulse

Soft-Boiled

&#x200B;

Not sure which is optimal here TBH, but I've been using Chansey with Eviolite. This is a basic support set that can heal everyone on the team, heal status conditions with Healer, set up screen, and use Helping Hand. Personally I prefer using Grimmsnarl as my special support, but this works if the raid boss has super effective moves against Grimmsnarl or if you just want to play a more ""traditional"" support healer role.

Day 0,121: Starmie!

&#x200B;

[Art by Chuz0r on Deviantart!](https://preview.redd.it/8dv5950cv26a1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=0837e49aaf3060d65ad827ee03b47c422892ee04)

Starmie isn't much different from Staryu, but the things it *does* add really adds to it. It ups the alien vibe just a bit. I actually really like Starmie -- Maybe it's the red/purple that catches my eye but it's just kind of appealing.

I've always wanted to use one on a team, but since I primarily do Nuzlockes or challenges it never really seems to be in the cards -- I do like it though!

Starmie's shiny is a *bit* of a downgrade from its pre-evo but imo I still think it holds on its own even if it loses that really cool pop. Shiny Starmie turns into a darker hue of purple/blue (perwinkle?) and the gem/gem holder turns red with the gem turning blue. It's a really nice shiny!

Overall, I think Starmie ranks a little higher than Staryu -- **B!**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope you enjoyed my ramblings! Let me know what you think of Starmie, I'd love to hear it!

Day 0,120: Staryu!

&#x200B;

[Art by Oddsocket on Deviantart!](https://preview.redd.it/lz05tlont26a1.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=e074d71276212383922e4d570236cc6e1b279e30)

Staryu's a really interesting Pokemon to me, because while it's taking on a starfish look; It feels almost... alien.

Would it be weird if I admitted that it creeped me out a little?

Which is such a shame because I adore marine life and marine Pokemon -- if you couldn't tell from how I ranked Horsea. But Staryu just.. I don't know. It gives me the weird heebies

I've never used the Staryu/Starmie evolution line in any playthrough, and I don't think I've seen anything of note about them either which is.. weird. The only thing that comes to mind is Misty's Staryu/Starmie that was pretty prominent in the anime.

A *good* thing about Staryu is its shiny!! Staryu has a top tier shiny -- It turns white with the gem turning blue! Although when I double checked, for some reason Pokemon Go's shiny is a weird green tint? Which is so wild because in every other game it's white. That's... weird.

But regardless of Pokemon Go's weirdness, it's a top tier shiny and I really need to hunt for it one day! It's so good

Hmmm... Staryu will go in... **C+**. While it creeps me out it's not a *bad* creep. While the creepy alien aesthetic combats against the cute starfish design it *could* have, I also think it applies a special charm.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I got confused on days so expect another post immediately after! Let me know what you think of Staryu, I'd love to hear it!

3. Evolution being manual. Choosing when your Pokemon evolves once its evolution condition is fulfilled is one of the best things PLA introduced. No “Wrong Gimmighoul evolved by accident” accidents.

Without further ado, introducing the first Water type to repeat it's subtype from a previous Water type!

**120 - Staryu**

Y'know this is going to sound really hypocritical after I just somewhat defended the Goldeen line but I legitimately think Staryu and Starmie are like... Really boring. Like, completely indefensible ""basic recreation of marine species"" boring. Water types have the most bloated roster and I think it's Staryu that started it, NOT Goldeen.

Like, it's not bad - it's completely inoffensive in every way! Well. Except the part where it's a Psychic type but I get the pun. The Psychic type is also associated with outer space, so the 'star' Pokémon is Psychic, which... works I guess, but Psyduck was much more deserving of the typing. 

But the thing is... this is just a starfish. Literally almost all the Pokedex details are true of real star fishes. You just, slapped a gem on top of a starfish, gave it a psychic type, and called it a day. If there's anything else to this Pokémon, do tell me, because I'm not seeing it and Bulbapedia isn't sharing it. **C- Tier**, it's not bad, it's just... generic and below average.

Playing with your Favorites: East Sea Gastrodon (Tera Ground),2,zmem7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zmem7j/playing_with_your_favorites_east_sea_gastrodon/,1,1671087167.0,"I had a bad time in Scarlet Violet preparing one of my favorite Pokemon for Tera Raids. It's related to Tera typing, which I'll explain below and TL;DR at the bottom. You can get what you want, but the grind is sometimes tedious despite advances in other areas.

There are two versions of Shellos and Gastrodon: West Sea and East Sea. West Sea is pink with brown whereas East Sea is blue with green. I've always loved the blue/green color combo as a look. East Sea is my favorite.

Recently discovered Tera mechanics show moves with less than 60 BP become boosted to 60. I'll leave a link below, but essentially you can increase moves power to 60 if it matches your Tera type. I'd advise looking into it if you're not aware.

Mud-Slap was the first move that came to mind. 20 BP Special Ground move that guaranteed reduces accuracy by 1 stage. Tera Raid battles seemed a good format where reducing accuracy benefits the whole party. Bosses can remove negative effects once and are immune to Status moves when shielded, but the accuracy loss is an added effect so you can apply it anytime. After 3 attacks you can Terastallize which boosts Mud-Slap to 60 BP, gets double STAB (potentially), and increases damage dealt because of Tera form.

I chose Gastrodon for its Storm Drain Ability and sole weakness to Grass. Gastrodon also gets Muddy Water which grants two STAB type coverage that both lower accuracy. Vaporeon can also do this and has better stats (and arguably better movepool), but it misses out on STAB Mud-Slap, double STAB Tera, and having to change Tera type to Ground. Both are good.

My goal was East Sea Gastrodon: Tera Ground! This is when problems started. After breeding for Shellos, I realized Gastrodon isn't Ground type until it evolves. So I have to: change its type for 50 shards (don't have enough), catch a Tera Raid Ground East Sea Gastrodon, or catch a wild East Sea Gastrodon. 

I thought catching a wild one seemed easiest. There's a fixed spawn in North Province Area Three. However, it also had fixed stats, nature, and Tera Water. There may be a way to alter it, but I couldn't from any save-scum methods. So I went to catch one in the only spawn area: North Province Area One.

Gastrodons spawn on beaches and North Province Area One only has two: an island and a tiny beach in the ""unmarked map DLC"" corner (which may not actually be in the Area). Never seen one swimming and couldn't find one on land or sea. I tried: Encounter Ground sandwiches, force-spawn-killing on the island, swimming back and forth. Nothing. If anyone has seen a Gastrodon there, please let me know.

Eventually, I caved and caught a West Sea Gastrodon which is much easier to find. I'll keep an eye out for one, but East Sea Gastrdon Tera Ground seemed not worth it. Ridiculous I couldn't find a Pokemon with its own Tera typing. I'm sure there's more examples of this. Tera mechanics create a need for Tera Raids, but also introduce problems to fashion a self-induced crisis (and possible paid-DLC future solution).

TL;DR - Tera Typing made me decide to use West Sea Gastrodon over East Sea because it's easier to get Tera Ground.

What’s up with the Paldea Pokémon League’s gloves?,3,zme94c,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zme94c/whats_up_with_the_paldea_pokémon_leagues_gloves/,3,1671085865.0,"I first noticed them on Geeta and thought “oh, they’re just a fancy design element bc she’s the top champion”. Maybe plot relevant, but only to the extent that Geeta is plot relevant in the DLC, if at all.

But I just noticed that the Elite Four wear the same gloves. This includes Larry, who lacks the gloves while he’s acting as Medali gym leader.

So, what’s up with these gloves?

The design seems to look like an eye with lashes, comparable to the Sheikah monks from Breath of the Wild. They could also be seen as crystals if you look at the middle line, with the lashes being refracted light? The latter would tie into Terastal, while the former would be something entirely new.

What could these gloves mean for the story? Do they symbolize Geeta keeping a close eye on the Elite Four? Do they represent something related to the DLC, like possibly the third legendary, hence the unusually specific design? Or are they purely decorative and meant to keep uniformity while on the clock?",2022-12-15 08:31:05

Do you think shiny Pokemon should be expanded upon?,0,zmbzkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zmbzkr/do_you_think_shiny_pokemon_should_be_expanded_upon/,0,1671078284.0,"There are many possibilities with the concept of shiny Pokemon. I have never understood why each Pokemon is limited to one alternate color scheme. Moreso, some of the designs are a complete waste. 

In Scarlet & Violet, the game goes further than ever to explain how shinies work; what they are, the odds, and how to improve those odds. 

Shiny hunting has never been easier, or more fun. The developers seem to be leaning into the idea of optimizing shiny hunting while keeping it a rare occurrence for the average player. This is a great optimization, in my opinion.

Despite this, the shiny designs continue to move towards bland/miniscule changes that are sometimes impossible to see (smh at Maushold). 

There is so much potential in creating extra shiny color schemes for each Pokemon. Imagine the odds stay the same, but there are several different shiny variations to look out for. A shiny Gengar could still be the OG muted purple that we all absolutely love (/s), but there could also be a white or black shiny as well. It would give the game a much longer shelf life as well. Catching a complete shiny dex would be quite the undertaking.

I think the best way would be to generate color schemes completely randomly. Every shiny would be unique. I don't think that's an impossible task, but I could be wrong. 

Either way, what do you think? Is it time to expand upon the concept? Or is it fine the way it is? Also, why do you think some shiny designs are given better care and attention than others? Is it intentional?",2022-12-15 06:24:44

But if I use one of the meta Pokémon listed above even if it's not type of active, destroy anything. 


**There's also no variety in the raids at all.** You will see the same 10 or 15 Pokémon again and again and again and again. The first one they released was Charizard, the most basic Pokémon possible. Like seriously? Then, tyranitar and salamance. Basically just going for all the low hanging fruit and these two aren't even good currently. At least Charizard was useful. Tyranitar and salamance are just so useless. Glass cannons that get destroyed so fast. I was hoping we'd get 6-7 star raids of legendaries already in the game as raids, of super rare Pokemon or something...",2022-12-15 00:52:24

What if pokemon added a sound type? (leave a comment below with what type u want added),0,zm7nxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zm7nxc/what_if_pokemon_added_a_sound_type_leave_a/,15,1671065699.0,"In this post i want to share my theory for how i think this type could be implemented.

First and foremost the why? I think the sound type can provide a much needed balance to the game, and unlike the fairy type i dont think where replacing 1 tyrant with another in this situation. Also the sound type would just be cool lol.

Strengths: Water, Fairy, Psychic, Steel, Rock
Weaknesses: Ice, Electricity, Dark, Ground, Bug
Resistances: Water, Fairy, Psychic, Steel, Rock
NVE: Bug, Ground, Electricity, Dark, Ice

Explanation: so for y i chose these type interactions, i tried to keep logic in kind while also adding nerfs and buffs to other types. Snow and bug and weak types but i didn't just make them strong against sound for the heck of it, bugs produce allot of sound so ita logical to assume sound wouldn't do much damage to it and snow is great for weakening sound waves. As for strengths steel and fairy are dominant in the meta and have pretty cool reasons for why i picked them to be weak to sound. For steel its ultrasonic welding (google it) and for fairy its sound polution (google it)

Overall i think the sound type opens the door for new cool pokemon designs and a nice new identity and power up for pokemon already exist who fit under the sound umbrella.",2022-12-15 02:54:59
What are top 10 Pokémon that deserves Megas,2,zm8xg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zm8xg3/what_are_top_10_pokémon_that_deserves_megas/,10,1671069186.0,"I would give the Kalos Starters, Hydreigon, Noivern, Flygon, Haxorus, Aegislash, Arbok, Skarmory, Chandelure, and Volcarona

All their mega typing
Kalos Starters - Same type
Hydreigon - Dark/Dragon
Noivern - Flying/Dragon
Flygon - Bug/Dragon
Haxorus - Dragon/Steel
Aegislash - Steel/Ghost
Arbok - Poison/Dark
Skarmory - Steel/Flying
Gigalith - Rock/Ground
Volcarona - Bug/Fire

First off let’s talk about the Kalos Starters. There self explanatory and they’ll be pretty cool. I mean the Alola Starters have Z-Moves and Galar Starters have Gigantamax forms. I would also like some ability changes (obviously) and my suggestion is giving Greninja Protean or Sharpness. I say give the hidden ability. I know that some ppl don’t want pseudo legends to have mega as bc they can be too much or OP like Mega Salamence. I wouldn’t e say Dragonite but the mega stone will sound weird. Hydreigon is a very underrated Pokémon and has been slept majorly. Also the typing is one of the coolest of all times. They can give Mega Launcher or Rough Skin to Hydreigon. Maybe too much but I don’t have recommendations. If it was a physical attacker, I give it Strong Jaw bc of the Pokédex. Another cool but underrated Pokémon is Noivern. They can give it Aerialate bc it lacks flying type moves. This can make boomburst very powerful by using Draco Meteor making this a semi-Mega Salamence (probably). Also this will be good bc a Wyvern having some attention is nice. Flygon is a must needed bc it’s awesome. This will be the first time and a good time to make it a Bug/Dragon. For a recommendation for the design, the wings on Flygon should be the shape of a dragon wing and have transparent hex patterns on the wings. The ability can be Sandstream activating Sandstorm or Compiund Eyes bc the eyes on Flygon can make Flygon’s vision pretty accurate. Especially on sandstorms. Haxorus is a Pokémon that I feel like it can be a pseudo legendary but isn’t. This Pokémon has a good design and nice shiny. It looks like a steel type Pokémon for obvious reasons so why not give Dragon/Steel. It’ll make a good typing and has OU power. It can have tough claws making physical contact moves insanely good or give it Rough Skin. Aegislash is another Kalos Pokémon that has a good design. I recommend them to make Aegislash a ghost creature with a big sword and shield while so keeping its ability. Arbok is a underrated Pokémon and has a cool design and is one of my friends #1 favorite Pokémon. Poison/Dark fits so much bc the intimidation from the pattern on the Kobra face. Keep intimate and once it mega evolves, the pattern becomes very creepy scaring wild Pokémon easily. They can give strong jaw bc snakes are known for biting. 2 underrated Pokémon are Skarmory and Gigalith. Skarmory is pretty cool and I love the idea they gave it making the typing so cool and it’s in dire need for special treatment. Gigalith is the same with Skarmory. Also Gigalith has a cool design so why not. Sandstream can work. Volcarona is a Pokémon that looks like a pseudo legendary. I mean even the Pokédex says about it bringing the sun so why not give it Drought.",2022-12-15 03:53:06

A post for Charizard lovers.,4,zm8gap,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zm8gap/a_post_for_charizard_lovers/,5,1671067832.0,"I know there is a lot of hate for Charizard but I just want to share why I love it so much and see if other people agree. 

My favorite starter has to be Charizard. I watched the episode where Ash's Charmeleon evolves so many times as a kid. I absolutely loved Ash's Charizard.

 Then I played my first video game ever Pokemon Red Rescue Team and this legendary rescue team shows up and Charizard is on that team. He shows up and starts bragging about how he can melt mountains and with how much the game hyped them up I believed him. He has a type disadvantage against Zapdos and just blatantly doesn't care. He doesn't even flinch at the thought of fighting a legendary with a type advantage.

Then I got my hands on a copy of Pokemon Red and I HAD to have a Charmander. Even though the first two gyms had an advantage I didn't care it HAD to be Charmander.  

Then I got Heart Gold and chose Typhlosion, beat the gyms and got all the way to the elite four and this champion Lance absolutely demolishes me with his Charizard and Dragonites making me think Charizard was even cooler. I HAD to beat red so Steven would give me a Charmander.

Then I played through Y version and there was this thing called megas that somehow made Charizard EVEN COOLER. I obviously asked the professor for Charmander. I much prefer mega Charizard Y because it doesn't change Charizard too much it just gave me more of what I thought already made Charizard cool.

I then got a copy of Leaf green and guess who I chose?

Then Let's go Pikachu comes around and I find out I CAN RIDE A CHARIZARD NOW!?

Next was Sword version. I boot up the game and what is the first thing I see? A BIG MONSTROUS CHARIZARD OWNED BY THE STRONGEST TRAINER IN THE WORLD.

Now the first thing I did in Scarlet after completing the Pokedex was breed a shiny Charmander. It only took me an hour leading me to name him Lucky. I have my shiny Charizard with me always. That's another reason why I like Charizard it looks SO COOL and somehow it's shiny makes it look EVEN COOLER. 

Which leads me to my last point it's design. Charmander is a perfect first stage. A perfect mix of cute and cool. It then turns into Charmeleon a perfect middle stage that bridges the transition in between Charmander and Charizard so well. Then turning into the super cool looking dragon I've come to love so much.

All these experiences with Charizard and it's cool design are why I will always love it so much!

So other Charizard lovers my question to you is why do YOU love Charizard?",2022-12-15 03:30:32

Hints/Inspirations for SV in Gen 3,0,zm83di,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zm83di/hintsinspirations_for_sv_in_gen_3/,1,1671066867.0,"Hey guys! New to Reddit, but not Pokemon. I have been playing the games since Blue and have ebbed and flowed in my interest in the games. I have had a lot of fun with SV and wanted to revisit some of the older games so I could transfer some old mons through some of the games I never played and also do my first-ever Ribbon Master.

I recently started this Journey and noticed something interesting while playing Sapphire. In the Lilycover Museum, you can view paintings of some of your mons that have done really well in contests. This was honestly a place I don't think I ever visited when I played this way back in the day, so I wanted to take a detailed look around to see what was there and I noticed 2 specific things of interest.

First - On the first floor on the back wall in the middle, there are 2 photos, one that looks like an orange fruit (Orange from Scarlet), and a second that looks like a purple fruit (Grape from Violet, although this could also just be some sort of vase...). On its own, I would probably just consider this a weird coincidence, but there is another painting on this floor that made me raise an eyebrow.

In the right corner of this room, there is another painting. It talks about how this is a ""Legendary Pokemon from Long Ago"", but also that>! ""The artist painted this from imagination"".!< It is that last part that really got me thinking with some of the theories that>! the paradox pokemon are not from past/future, but are instead created from imagination as seen in the Scarlet/Violet book. !<

Could be a subtle hint from nearly 20 years ago, or maybe was some sort of inspiration for these games? Or just a coincidence? It's a theory based on a theory so I doubt it... but I want to believe :P

I'm not sure if anyone else has noted this as of yet but I would love to hear what some of you think!

-There’s a glitch in the games when you have the ability Huge power that when the Pokémon removes the affect of your abilities it will show a certain level of damage then reverse it. This is why raids are being healed when they should be dead.

-I would also suggest not using belly drum as you have no healing and even if you do end up doing damage half the time your teammates have already got the Pokémon to half health so you lose your stat buffs.",2022-12-15 03:08:10

I've been a pokemon fan all my life. My first pokemon game was Pearl back in gen 4, and I've been hooked on the series ever since. I've bought nearly every mainline game in the series since, and I've played several of the spin off games. I've even played a bit of the card game, and watched some of the anime, though admittedly I don't really spend too much time watching the series anymore.

All that is to say that I've been a fan of this franchise a long time. I love nearly everything about the franchise, and I always get excited over every new release.

But talking about pokemon is, and always has been, exhausting. 

Every new release I've seen, from Black and White, to the newest games in the series, Scarlet and Violet has been absolutely plauged with people complaining about every little detail. It feels like every new release in the series is met with a tidal wave of criticism, from how the games look and play, to how bad every new set of starters is awful and the worst ones yet. It's the same song and dance every new generation.

That's not to say that these games don't deserve criticism. Scarlet and Violet in particular run horribly on the switch. And before those games released, the series was starting to feel a little stale, even for a fangirl like myself. I'm not saying that there shouldn't be any discussion around the problems of the series.

But it seriously gets exhausting. It feels like every time a new game releases, every big name streamer and influencer trashes the on the series. And you don't even have to stay in pokemon the circles to hear this sort of thing. A lot of times, I've been on YouTube or some other social media website looking at a topic completely separate from pokemon, and I still see people trashing on the new games.

And it wouldn't be so exhausting, if it didn't happen every single time a new game releases. It happened during the relsse of black and white, sun and moon, sword and shield, and now Scarlet and Violet. I'm sure it even happened back when gen 4 released, but I can't say. I was too young to notice at the time.

I don't know if its just a me thing or not. It's gotten to the point where I usually dread the new pokemon games being announced, because I know I'll see nothing but hate towards the series for months on end.

Am I just overreacting? What do you think?

The watercolor/storybook art style is very visually satisfying, and the main story, while very short (I got the end credits sequence at just under 12 hours of play time), was lovely and fun to play through. I just wish the story was as long as the story in the Explorers of Sky/Time/Darkness, but seeing as Red/Blue rescue team were the first PMD games released, a more bare bones main story is to be expected since they obviously had to figure out the mechanics first and foremost.

My only major complaint is that the controls in the 3D Mystery Dungeon Games seem to be a lot more janky and annoying than the 2D games, but that's probably just because of the fact that top-down dungeon crawler type games usually control best in 2D anyway....

I would like to know your story from your Pokémon journey or your first Pokémon game. It's like picking your first starter and starting your journey from Route 1. 😄

I started playing when I was a kid, the game was Pokémon Blue in Gameboy Advance. I already watched some Pokémon Anime on TV before playing but playing a Pokémon game feels much more different and exciting. 

My first ever starter was Squirtle. I am only borrowing the GBA that is why I was never able to finish the game. I remember that I used to play 4hrs straight. Maybe less or maybe more before my battery runs out. I never had any rechargeable batteries at that time. I always reach Celadon before giving it back to my uncle since he owns the GBA. 😅 When I get to Celadon, I always have a Lvl 40+ Blastoise and I never trained any Pokémon besides him. Man, I felt some nostalgia while composing these hahaha.

The GBA was eventually given to me after some years and I was given by my uncle with another Pokémon game. The game was called Pokémon ShinyGold. Since I was still a kid that time, I have no idea that it was a rom hack and it was unfinished. That explains why I cannot go to the building that goes to Mahogany town. I can only visit Cherrygrove, Violet, Azalea, Goldenrod, Ecruteak and Olivine. But even though it was unfinished, I really enjoyed playing it since the hacked game comes in a colored version like Fire Red or RBY. I do not know its based rom tho. Hahaha. I spent a lot of hours playing it and my starter there was Totodile. I do not know but I always pick Water type Starters hahaha.

Then next, I was able to get an android phone. And my GBA doesn't work anymore. I tried downloading some emulator for GBA and that is when the time I tried playing Emerald. This time, it feels really different because I know that this will be my first Pokémon game that I can finish. So I started playing it and I picked Mudkip. Hahaha yes, Mudkip! I liked it maybe because I always ends up choosing a Water starter? Hahaha and back when I played the rom hack, I always find a Mudkip in the cave near Azalea. So going back, I beat the game. Man, it was very challenging. The contests were very great. The Pokémons are amazing. I get to fight 2 villains in one game. Catching Legendary Pokémons was very very amazing especially when you are catching every Regis. Catching Rayquaza was very tough tho. 😅

Since then, Mudkip became my favorite starter, but I also liked all the Hoenn starters. And my favorite all time favorite legendary is Rayquaza. It is very cool and my favorite type is Dragon. 

Then years later I was able to play different Pokémon games from the DS and 3DS. 

How about you guys? What was your first Pokémon game and how did you end up playing Pokémon? Please feel free to share it in the comments. 😃",2022-12-15 01:55:36

Small PSA For Breeding Mechanics With Destiny Knot in SV:,0,zm5jgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zm5jgp/small_psa_for_breeding_mechanics_with_destiny/,11,1671060091.0,"I’ve been breeding pokemon in SV for a few weeks now, and I’ve discovered some stuff with the destiny knot that I think some people should know, as it could be important for competitive breeding (which I do expect to somewhat sadly decline in popularity), and because I haven’t seen anything posted about this online yet.  
- My background/intro because why tf not?  I mainly breed shinies, but I really started focusing on shiny breeding back in SM when I was fortunate enough to get a 6IV Japanese Ditto, which I used to breed my own competitive level and (mainly) shiny mons.  I bred Pokemon religiously for years, up until the release of SWSH, where I honestly fell out of the Pokemon scene.  With that being said, I want that to be a warning that I have been out of the loop on breeding for the last couple years, so if there’s anything here that has been common knowledge, I’m sorry.  Anyways, here’s what I’ve found over the last few weeks of breeding!  
1.  Destiny knot IV transfer seems to just sometimes be outright broken.  I will say that it GENERALLY works as it should for me.  With the breeding I’ve been doing, I typically like to get a base breed pokemon with strong IVs.  That 6IV ditto is still in SM, and I’m not paying for Pokemon bank rn, so I need to do this more often now.  I’ve been focused on shiny hunting, and I bred for a base Spiritomb for one hunt using a 5 IV ditto from a raid.  This was fine, and I had no issues at all.  Found a good host within 3 eggs.  However, when I tried to do this with a Fuecoco, another Pokemon that I’m hunting alongside this Spiritomb, I found that most of the IVs wouldn’t transfer.  With 20 eggs produced from the same ditto parent, WITH the destiny knot still equipped, the best Fuecoco I got was 3 IVs, and I believe I only got two of those.  Not sure if this is a memory leak issue, but it’s still concerning, and I’ve found the destiny knot to be very wishiwashi with IV inheritance.  
2.  Breeding with multiple destiny knots blue-balls your Pokemon.  This is the main thing that I found that I wanted to share.  I know that two parents can’t both hold destiny knots.  However, what I’m taking about here are three separate parents meant to breed with other dittos in my party.  It is a fact that you can breed multiple different species of Pokemon at a time, and that’s what I’ve been doing.  It’s actually one of the better things to come from picnic breeding, being able to breed multiple types of Pokemon at once.  However, for some reason, if you give your base parents (that aren’t dittos, since getting a good IV foreign ditto hasn’t happened to me yet in this game) destiny knots, each to transfer their set IV spreads to their children, the game suddenly decides that it’s time for your Pokemon to practice abstinence.  I sat for an hour with egg power 2 with no eggs at all.  I tried restarting the game and making another sandwich, and still nothing.  Then, I remove the destiny knots from the two other Pokemon I’m hunting, and they are getting it on in seconds.  Keep this in mind if eggs aren’t spawning for you.  The game is very finicky about that.  This also gives me a segway into my most recent major finding:  
3.  Whoever holds the single destiny knot gets all the maidens.  After removing the destiny knot from the two other Pokemon and leaving one on Spiritomb, I sat back and let them produce a LOT of eggs, thinking that I was getting eggs for all three mons I had brought.  My party had three unique mons, and three foreign dittos.  After getting 5-6 boxes, I started hatching, and I realized that every single egg I hatched was a Spiritomb.  I will say that I don’t know what would happen if the ditto holds the knot, but I do want to do some testing.  Anyways, I hope you found this somewhat helpful, interesting, or both.  If anyone finds anything new, or has any questions, please let me know!",2022-12-15 01:21:31
What are your favorite Pokédex?,1,zm5jal,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zm5jal/what_are_your_favorite_pokédex/,0,1671060079.0,"It's really a hard question because we can have you absolute favorite and the bottom of the Earth in the same dex, but I want to see what is the general opinion in this subreddit.   
I think Kalos and Alola have some the pleaseant designs to me, or like, dunno, is just a feel, because we have some weirdos here (I am looking you Diggerbsy and Crabominable).

But for some reason I like when the dex make me feel I want to use the Pokémon even some weirdos, like Cloyster. Because of that, I enjoy Gen 1 and Gen 3 dex. Gen 5 is pretty close to, but for every really cool Pokémon they have some the awful design for me like Klink.   
Maybe is various factors:  
\-The overall artstyle. Gen 1 and Gen 2 while not my favorites Gens have some really good artstyle to me. I even enjoy that in the humans, with some upgrades of course.   
\-Your favorites but also the quantity of Pokémon you least dislike. I can say that for me Paldea and Hoeen don't have Pokémon I really dislike too much.   
\-Nostalgia, obvious.  
\-Union? I don't know I express, but some dex the feel of seeing that art where ""every Pokémon is here and that really work"" hit me in some dex, like Kalos and Galar.",2022-12-15 01:21:19

My gf’s first true Legendary Capture experience,47,zlzrc6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/zlzrc6,5,1671045786.0,"My gf wanted to start playing the true Pokémon games recently. She had only played Go in earnest. Since I happened to have Heart Gold, we found a Soul Silver and we started playing her first run. I have been playing parallel with her the whole time and we just hit Luiga and Ho-Oh.

I got ridiculously lucky, used a lvl 43 Gengar with Hypnosis and Dream Eater, and had Ho-Oh in 3 balls.

My gf, on the other hand, had the “true” experience. She had a lvl 41 Polywhirl with Hypnosis and Blizzard. The hypnosis would almost always hit second but, Luiga would somehow avoid every 3 of 4 Blizzards even though he was sleeping. When she would eventually get Luiga down to red while sleeping, they escaped a total of 15 ultra balls and 4 heavy balls. During that, she had to juggle swapping and reviving where she used 9 hyper potions and she had to revive Polywhirl 4 times. By the end she had 2 pokemon left and was ready to save and quit… after getting back to a Pokecenter. But since she had to drop her flying Pokémon for a hm slave back in Cianwood City, she didn’t have a flying. Which means she had to swim back… and since she wanted to save money by not buying too many repels, she ran out. 

Cherry on top; she ran into a swimmer she hadn’t hit the first time through the Whirl Islands. Easy fight, but dam was she done for this session.",2022-12-14 21:23:06

Pokémon that weren't as good in their debut generation: Gen 1 Edition,2,zlxjex,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zlxjex/pokémon_that_werent_as_good_in_their_debut/,3,1671040420.0,"Let's talk about Pokémon that aren't as good in their debut generation, shall we? This could be a due to a multitude of issues, such as bad movepools, bad stats and the like. The first 2 Gens have it the worst, but that doesn't mean it stopped with Gen 3. This will just be about Gen 1 for now.

Charizard: No Flying STAB in RGB, only learns Fly in Yellow. OK Special stat that gets a Sp.Atk buff in Gen 2. At least it gets Slash, Flamethrower and Earthquake, so it's not all bad.

Pidgeot: No Flying STAB until either Wing Attack (35 power) at level 31, Sky Attack or Fly by TM, with Fly being its best STAB. Learns no coverage moves. Outclassed hard by Fearow and Dodrio.

Arbok: No STAB aside from Poison Sting and Acid.

Sandslash: No STAB moves by level-up. Stats aren't amazing. Outclassed by Dugtrio and the Nidos.

Golbat: Best STAB is weak Wing Attack. Doesn't evolve into Crobat yet.

Parasect: It's got Spore and Swords Dance. That's all the good I can really say about a slow Pokémon with 3 4x weaknesses (double weak to Poison in Gen 1).

Venomoth: Stats aren't impressive, and it gets no good STAB moves. Gets powders and Psychic moves, but so does Butterfree, and it shows up earlier.

Primeape/Hitmonchan: Best STAB is Submission (not a good move at all). Terrible Special stat makes coverage useless, and makes them frail as well.

Rapidash: Shows up late, and is outclassed by the likes of Flareon, Arcanine and Ninetales.

Farfetch'd: Gets Slash. That's about it.

Muk/Weezing: Poison attacks suck in Gen 1, with the best being Sludge. Most coverage is based off their lower attacking stat.

Onix: You know why it's bad.

Electrode: Fastest ball in the land, but learns no STAB by level-up.

Rhydon: Amazing with the right TMs, but gets absolutely no STAB by level-up. Normal moves for days.

Tangela: Best level-up STAB in RGB is Absorb at level 29. Gets Vine Whip at 29 in Yellow. No good coverage moves.

Kangaskhan: Bad Special makes it fall over to a little water or leaves.

Seaking: OK Special means it's outclassed by most Water types.

Scyther: Gets no STAB until Yellow, where it learns Wing Attack. Slash and Swords Dance are great, but not together.

Porygon: Doesn't have an Upgrade. A bit gimmicky until it starts getting better moves in later generations.

This list could be longer but I'd be typing all day. Got any more to add?",2022-12-14 19:53:40

Just imagine a Pokémon legends game based on Alola. Legends: Tapu (Repost with an addition)

Starters: Chespin, Totadile, Scorbunny
Backstory: You and two of your buddies from a small town in Kanto decide to join a crew of 5 others, a Researcher named Professor Rita who studies the recent invention of Pokéballs and how to improve on them, a craftsman, two builders, and your captain Jonathan Gilberry.
Rivals: Citrus, and Quincy (Pokémon are unchosen starters)
Early Plot: You and your crew ship wreck on MeleMele island where in the middle of the island you find a small settlement of people and your goal is to help develop and grow their town but trouble comes your way when a group of pirate demand spices from the people of MeleMele island you help defeat the pirates and repair your boat with help from the village of people but instead of leaving you and your crew decide to help the people establish a presence of all the islands and the pirates seemed to have know what you were doing and attack out of know where and destroy an outpost but the pirates seemed to be more organized and strategized their attacks, you have to retrieve Pokémon for the villagers to fight with.
Catching mechanics: you have a limited number of pokeballs and once your run out a story event takes place where a girl (Lani short for LokeLani) teaches you a way to catch Pokémon without pokeballs you have to gather enough berries and depending on what Pokémon you’re feeding it requires a different amount once they are fed enough they join you out of friendship otherwise with pokeballs it’s just the Pokémon legends Arceus catching mechanics.

That’s all I’m going to write today since it’s late but oh well, also please remember this is a idea for a game that is created just for fun so don’t think it’s a leak thank you for reading!

Also feel free to make your own changes to the idea in the comments I think that’d be cool! 

Addition:

Something very interesting has just happened to me.,3,zluz9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zluz9i/something_very_interesting_has_just_happened_to_me/,1,1671034300.0,"So i decided to replay ""Omega Ruby"" with pokémon that are considered bad, on the GTS i decide to put a Seedot and ask for a Sunkern thinking no one would be there anymore.

Not only did i end up getting the Sunkern, it was a shiny one with a modest nature and its EVs where completely maxed out in special attack and speed, it feels weird to say that a Sunkern is the strongest member of my team because it's always a higher level than the rest because of the boosted experience.

Im pretty sure that i got some sort of breedject becaue it was level 1 and the description said it was hatched somewhere and there was no URL in sight. If it is hacked then at least they are putting more effort in making them look legit.",2022-12-14 18:11:40

Mechanics that are retconned and then brought back in a new form,3,zlutvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zlutvv/mechanics_that_are_retconned_and_then_brought/,2,1671033945.0,"Thinking about it, there’s been some suspicious instances throughout the Pokémon series where they’ve axed a mechanic in one gen, only to release the next gen with a seemingly rebalanced/enhanced version of that mechanic, and I think these removals are done deliberately to get players used to not using the old mechanic for a gen before they introduce the “new and improved” version. 

There are two examples I can think of: in gen VI they removed the type gems (except normal), with a lot of people thinking it was because of how broken they made certain mons in VGC. Then gen VII rolls around and they introduce Z-Crystals, making it so you can only have one use per team and giving certain mons signature ones. 

In gen VIII, Hidden Power was removed (which I think was largely due to it being impossible to implement HP Fairy without changing the IVs needed for at least a few of the old HP types, completely changing the HP type of mons that would be transferred up). Lo and behold, gen IX comes in and gives us Terastal types + a higher base power move that acts as a sort of Hidden Power replacement that can now be used on physical based mons and can also be Fairy type. Again, it’s now relegated to being a one-mon-per-battle mechanic, preventing multiple mons on a team from having an extra coverage type otherwise unavailable to them. 

These mechanic changes feel very deliberate, and I wondered if it’s something anyone else had noticed? Can anyone think of any other possible examples of Game Freak or TPCI retconning certain mechanics and bringing back what seems like an updated version of it later on?",2022-12-14 18:05:45

[S/V] Best Pokemon for Tera Raid by Type - Grass,11,zlujo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zlujo5/sv_best_pokemon_for_tera_raid_by_type_grass/,5,1671033265.0,"*I thought I'd do this series if there is anyone who wants a roster of all types for Tera Raids, starting with Grass.*

**Introduction**

When I first looked at grass I didn't think there was much there but I found a couple that are pretty good in the right setting. As always you want to pick it into where your moves do super effective damage and their moves your typing resists. Since so many of these pokemon use Grassy Terrain it's really good into Electric Pokemon because they usually set their own Electric Terrain at some point.

**Methodology**

A lot of Pokemon could work, but I mostly looked for Pokemon with:

* High Base Stats for their typing
* High Attacking/Special Attacking Stats for their typing
* Access to Self Healing
* Access to Self Stat Boosts

Let me know if you have any Pokemon you think would be good or any suggestions to the below builds. I'll do Water tomorrow.

**Notes**

There are a lot of of options for Grass because they have a lot of self healing through drains and synthesis. They also get access to Nasty Plot/Sword Dance/Growth. I listed what I think is the most viable below. If you were to pick one, I would say Gogoat is the best Physical Attacker and Arboliva is the best Special Attacker.

Below are the builds.

* All Physical Attackers are Adamant Nature with 252 HP/ 252 Atk EV Spread and All Special Attackers are Modest Nature with 252 HP/252 SpAtk.
* Bold are the moves I think it has to have while non-bold are other options.
* All Tera Types will be Grass for the extra STAB.
* These are mostly focused on Solo Session but the moves can be switched up for Online

**Best Pokemon**

***Gogoat - Physical Attacker - Grass Pelt***

\- Possible Moves: **Grassy Terrain, Bulk Up,** Leech Horn, Leaf Blade, Leech Seed

\- Possible Items: Miracle Seed, Terrain Extender

\- Strategy: lay down Grassy Terrain, Keep 1-2 Bulk Ups, Leech Horn to keep HP up, Leaf Blade Otherwise

***Arboliva - Special Attacker - Seed Sower***

\- Possible Moves: **Terrain Pulse, Giga Drain, Growth,** Any

\- Possible Items: Miracle Seed

\- Keep 1-2 Growth on you, Giga Drain if low, Terrain Pulse Otherwise

***Leafeon - Physical Attacker - Leaf Guard***

\- Possible Moves: **Swords Dance, Leaf Blade, Synthesis,** Sunny Day, Any

\- Possible Items: Miracle Seed, Life Orb, Heat Rock

\- Keep Sunny Day up, 1-2 Swords Dance, Synthesis if Low, Leaf Blade Otherwise

***Cacturne - Physical or Special Attacker (can do both) - Water Absorb***

\- Possible Physical Moves: **Swords Dance, Grassy Terrain, Seed Bomb,** Leech Seed, Ingrain, Sucker Punch

\- Possible Special Moves: **Nasty Plot, Grassy Terrain, Giga Drain, Energy Ball,** Dark Pulse

\- Possible Items: Miracle Seed, Terrain Extender

\- Keep Grassy Terrain down, 1-2 Stat boosts, Giga Drain if low, Seed Bomb/Energy Ball otherwise

***Lilligant - Special Attacker - Own Tempo***

\- Possible Moves: **Quiver Dance, Grassy Terrain, Giga Drain, Petal Dance**

\- Possible Items: Miracle Seed, Terrain Extender

\- Keep Grassy Terrain Down, 1-2 Quiver Dance, Giga Drain if low, Petal Dance otherwise (you get locked into Petal Dance so make sure you're pretty high HP)

***Scovillian - Special Attacker - Insomnia*** *(Thanks,* u/BoomTheBear86\*!)\*

\- Possible Moves: Growth, Giga Drain, Solar Beam, Sunny Day, Worry Seed, Will-o-Wisp, Flamethrower

\- Possible Items: Shell Bell, Miracle Seed

In an coordinated online session all of these would do well with Koraidon to set up Sunny Day or a Arboliva to set up Grassy Terrain

***Breloom - Physical Attacker - Poison Heal***

\- Possible Moves: Swords Dance, Drain Punch, Seed Bomb, Grassy Terrain, Worry Seed

\- Possible Items: Terrain Extender, Miracle Seed

**Lurantis - Special Attacker - Contrary**

\- Possible Moves: Leaf Storm, Giga Drain, Grassy Terrain

\- Possible Items: Terrain Extender, Miracle Seed

**Future Home Pokemon**

Zarude (Swords Dance, Jungle Healing)

Chesnaught (Belly Drum, Synthesis)

Hisui Lilligant (Swords Dance, Solar Blade, Synthesis, Sunny Day)

Rillaboom (Swords Dance, Screech, Grassy Terrain, Leech Seed, Drum Beating)

Day 0,119: Seaking!

&#x200B;

[Art by Oliver Hamlin on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/tanig478tv5a1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a005c0d54e2f4d8e94e65ec4fd3c8f2cb3dd238)

Okay, I actually *really* like Seaking which might come off as a bit of a shock since I was sort of meh towards Goldeen. I think Seaking is really pretty and does the Koi/Goldfish aesthetic REALLY GOOD. I'm a huge fan of its coloring and I'm drawn to a lot of fanart of it for that reason (I'm a sucker for Koi-like patterns)

Seaking also makes some of the prettiest Pokemon fusions out there. I have one of my own that's a Seaking/Vaporeon fusion and they're downright beautiful I LOVE THEM. (cue my best friend yelling at me that I don't love them enough >v<;; ~~You don't need context)~~

But yeah, I've never *used* a Seaking because even though visually I think it's wonderful (I wish it was a touch more pleasing to look at but I still like hte patterns well enough) I don't think it's up to par in the sense of actually using one? Idk I've never used one maybe it'd surprise me?

Another thing that I'm not too big of a fan of is the shiny -- It sort of just turns a paler orange with a few hints of yellow. Personally I think this shiny would be amazing if the black/orange just swapped but ALAS THIS WAS BACK WHEN SHINIES WERE JUST PICKED BY A CLICK OF A BUTTON.

Overall, I'll put Seaking in the **B** rank. I like it uwu

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I cannot for the life of me remember if I did Goldeen yesterday or the day before so I don't know if I need to do two posts today -- So I guess we'll see in a bit? But I hope you enjoyed my ramblings! Let me know what you think of Seaking, I'd love to hear it!

See ya!

But, why not make the pokemon look cooler? Why do we have to keep having these humanoid ugly looking pokemon? 

The only reason I ever got into Pokemon when I was younger was because I thought all of the Pokemon in Gen 3 looked awesome. 

I don't know if it's maybe that i've just grown up with the games but it seems like the ""cool"" factor of the game is slowly being pushed out and is being made strictly for just kids. 

I think the last mon i remember being like ""holy shit, that looks badass!"" was probably Tyrantrum. Why is there not anymore of those? ESPECIALLY the starters. It's just miss after miss after miss with atleast 2/3 of the starters. Skeledirge is the only exception to this as he does look pretty neat. They had the chance to make the other 2 look so good but they just didn't. What's with the wacky proportions when it comes to their body? Quaqaval would've looked 10x better if it didn't look like he was about to shit himself.

So about Galarian Yamask evolving into Runerigus...,2,zlnq2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zlnq2k/so_about_galarian_yamask_evolving_into_runerigus/,0,1671014327.0,"So you know how when Yamask evolves into Runerigus, it basically absorbs all the dark energy of the yamask to become runerigus?

Does this mean the Yamask itself dies and becomes a new entitiy/pokemon?

And if the Yamask does die does the Runerigus inherit its memories and personality?

Or, if the Yamask doesn't die... then does it basically just simply ""Change or evolve"" once all the dark energy has been absorbed into the slab on its tail?

This has been on my mind for the longest and honestly this is a very interesting pokemon. I used it on my Sword team and she is a staple in it. I love her design and lore.",2022-12-14 12:38:47
Which of the following Pokémon games is your favorite?,4,zlnmy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/zlnmy1/which_of_the_following_pokémon_games_is_your/,32,1671013994.0,"Hi guys! With the release of the new title Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, I would like to know which Pokémon game is still the best for you and why?

 I will be getting my own Switch on my birthday and this will help me to decide if I will be getting other Pokémon games on Switch besides Legends Arceus since I will surely get it.

So far, my favorites were the Gen V games and Gen III games (ORAS included).

P.S. I did not include GBA games since I already enjoyed all of them. I also played games from Gen I to Gen VII.

Please let this be a healthy thread and discussion.

I am stuck between picking BDSP or Violet/Scarlet. I bought PLA, loved it and only disliked the lack of battling mechanics against real players. I am aware BDSP was lazily done and the reason why I am only considering it is because of nostalgia. I also have my dream Sinnoh team way back from Kalos that I competitively bred  and have been on a mission to collect ribbons for said team. 

On the other hand, Violet/Scarlet is very off putting to me because of the reviews surrounding performance/frame rate and underwhelming  graphics. I am aware the switch is no powerhouse of a device but given that BOTW was released in 2017 (albeit with a far longer development time) Violet/Scarlet does not even come close to the visuals of BOTW.

So should I get BDSP or Violet/Scarlet?",2022-12-14 10:58:14

I'm of the side that wants to include all the major mechanics introduced into the series over the years in a fanon game idea that changes how the world develops over time based on choices made during what would be the main playthrough. 

It would include out of battle gameplay that was introduced in PLA, bringing back field moves (not HMs, but having your pokemon use a specific move,) to open up smaller areas in the world (also wouldn't be locking important story parts,) megas, dyna/ gigantamax, z crystals, Tera raids, ways to change what pokemon would natively appear in the region based on story choices you make during the initial run, with representation of pretty much all the other regions, while still having an entire new region to explore and pokemon to discover.

While trying to explain my ideas woth a friend, I was basically shut down with them claiming that it would be too much. Real bummer, cause I figured they would be all for a big world to explore, with loads of player choice in how the world developed basically ensuring your playthrough likely wouldn't be the exact same as another players, while not completely locking big mechanics from the game completely. Would you play a game that theoretically could pull this sort of plan off?

I realize feature creep is a thing that can indeed ruin long standing series, but I believe we could have a game where all main features are included, without having the dex cut to a third of its total. All while running smoothly on designated hardware, but I'm not at a stage or have the programming knowledge to actually do anything about making my thoughts physical, I gotta at least flesh out the ideas on paper.

Comment,1,j0t0bwx,,0,1671424565.0,"Get arceus no doubt in my mind. Arceus is just miles and miles better than SV, I was timid to buy it initially due to it being so different from previous games but it literally changed my perspective and what I thought I wanted from Pokémon games. Challenging but captivating story with both wholesome and exciting aspects, it wasn’t just the animations and battle mechanics but it just felt like a true Pokémon game, that isn’t marketed just towards children or as a way to market for easy profit. Just a great game with a lot of things to do in an open setting you can just your time to enjoy it and every detail seems well thought while SV seems like it was so quickly thrown together… I sincerely hope they create another game similar to arceus even if they start releasing two separate styles of gameplay (ie sword and shield or scarlet and violet vs arceus) I’d be happy I just was so disappointed and don’t want to lose my love for Pokémon for money grabs from low quality writing and design for kids.",2022-12-19 06:36:05

You're more likely to find a good reproduction or resin cast version, quality and such notwithstanding. If you're somewhat skillful with an airbrush and/or a willingness to learn figure painting you could potentially end up with a figure that looks as good as if not potentially better (as quite a lot of these types of figures are often turned into garage kits because the real deal is generally extremely hard to get hold of if you miss the initial release window).",2022-12-19 06:35:54

Comment,1,j0t06ch,,0,1671424483.0,"I totally agree! I love the game but as someone who started with gen 1 I miss the little interactions that made the game so much more memorable and satisfying for the hardcore completionists among us. I miss having to talk to every little hidden NPC just to get that extra luxury ball or TM no one would know about otherwise. I especially miss the S.S. Anne and the little garbage pails that would sometimes give items when you randomly explored them. Personally, I would really love to see more of that going forward. Maybe I am just reminiscing of how Mega Man battle network was (because that was  a super common thing) but there is something just so satisfying that really ties you to the town, time and place when you find those little hidden gems. The game corner, safari zone, the mansion and backyard in X&Y, the haunted houses where you could get Rotom instead of just finding him in the wild, sprout tower, secret bases, the cute sauna, ninja boys, the light house quest with Sabrina and Ampharos, convoluted caves and forests with cool little detours or hidden components really did it for me in the series over the years. I really liked how hard some of them were and I grew to love having to consider using an escape rope without navigating the cave with the help of an online guide since when I played the only guides were the official strategy ones or a friend. I do like Artazon for how scenic it is, the cool maze, jungle gym, even nice gym quest as well as the beautiful bridges but feel they could have done more for sure especially with towns like Medali. Also the NPCs having a text box that indicates they are intractable with vs the ones that just blurt out a random line makes the experience more artificial.",2022-12-19 06:34:43

If you can get it, I would go with crystal, but gold and silver are still good on their own. I prefer silver. Again if you have a N64, having stadium 2 helps a lot. Gen 2 kinda sucks with evolution stones. I’ve found it helpful to just trade those items from gen 1 to 2 through stadium.

Comment,1,j0swz4t,,0,1671422790.0,"Charizard starts the raid with Overheat (1) and clears the SpAtk drop, then fights you with Fire Blast (2), Focus Blast (3), Hurricane (4), and Dragon Pulse (5).

I know Pokemon in raids tend to often have different moves when you exit and enter them, but it's not like they actually *use* more than 4 of them at any given time, unlike Charizard.



The Brick Break bit is in regards to Court Change, because it flips the battle field around. If someone set up Reflect and/or Light Screen and it has a ""Court Charge phase"" like Charizard's Sunny Day bit, then it would switch the field around and *take away* our screens for itself and gain those benefits for itself, since Brick Break can destroy those screens and thus remove the benefits it gained.",2022-12-19 06:06:30

Comment,1,j0swjxy,,0,1671422573.0,"i agree with you! i’m an extremely casual player, but i’m also a completionist. i really want to get the sweet herba mystica for the one professor at the school, but most of the 5 star raids are too difficult for me to complete alone and i dont have online. the few times i have completed raids AND received herba mystica as a reward, it’s never the sweet hm. it’s incredibly annoying and honestly turns me off from the game

i also was surprised the first time i tried to re-enter the titan caves and was blocked off. it’s kind of annoying that the caves were only available during cutscenes, even if herba mystica don’t spawn there. it’s a neat little place to hang out!

edit to add: i originally thought that herba mystica would appear with 4 star raids as well and was confused when i never received any, until i looked it up. it would make more sense to at least open them up to 4 star raid rewards, even if the reward rate for them is way lower. i would actually try to go for more raids in that case",2022-12-19 06:02:53

Unique buildings also not only serve as some indoor fluff, they also make the outside appearance of towns look more varied and unique and interesting. Yet, when these buildings do exist (and at least a handful of them does exist in Paldea), players might be interested to check them out and enter and explore them, because they are the buildings that stick out.

In my opinion, having these unique kind of places in a game goes hand in hand with providing unique interiors to explore, at least to a certain degree.

If the towns of Paldea had actually a considerable amount of outdoor content, that would definitely remedy the otherwise barebones content at least somewhat. But I'm surprised by how opposed some people seem to be towards entering buildings \^\^.",2022-12-19 05:42:06

I also would have tried to get Home compatibility up by February for each game like with SwSh when Home first came out because that seems like a decent amount of time, but I do like what they're doing with the event raids in SV by actually giving you access to some of the transfer-only Pokemon early via 7 Star Raids.",2022-12-19 05:39:59

Comment,5,j0ssl9l,,0,1671420542.0,"-There are three possible abilities assigned to nearly all Pokemon species in the code: Ability 1, Ability 2, and Hidden Ability. The ability shows up in the status screen and you can check on websites like Bulbapedia or Serebii to see which ability slot it is.

-Pokemon will keep the same ability slot if they evolve to a new species with different assigned abilities.

-Only Ability 1 and Ability 2 will appear in normal wild encounters. Hidden Abilities can only appear in special encounters, like raid battles or distribution events.

-The Ability Capsule is used to switch from Ability 1 to 2, or vice versa. If your Pokemon species' Ability 1 and 2 are the same ability, the game won't let you use it.

-The Ability Patch is the item used to switch from Ability 1 (or 2) to the Hidden Ability and vice versa.",2022-12-19 05:29:02

While I did enjoy the ancient towers in Johto, everything else was just a lame obstacle or a gimmick that I really didn't enjoy.

In fact, I hadn't considered it before, but maybe part of the reason I love this game so much is because of how much nonsense was cut out.

Comment,1,j0ss9q7,,0,1671420379.0,"gamefreak didn't give it the payoff it deserved. Hop's storyline was barely a footnote. sure he changed up his team constantly, complained about never being able to win, but he never *felt* like he did anything. 

Hop's dialogue should've reflected how much he compared himself to leon. i want lines like ""Lee wouldn't have made that mistake..."" when he whiffs a move, or have his dynamax animation be a sloppier version of leon's & have leon's animation get shown at some point, before the endgame, and that moment can't be commented on in game. (if GF did this, then fair enough, i was wrong)

Hop's story completely skips the bits where he's angry and confused, asking himself why he can't live up to his brother's strength. Hop's character development *skips the fucking character development.*

Hop's arc feels like he just suddenly realized that he can't live up to his brother, so he might as well do another job that has him live and work with pokemon, just like his brother, but in his own way. that shit pisses me off. 

Hop's story is so disappointing because it feels like the writer's outline. it feels like someone wrote ""let's have the champion's brother be the rival, and let's have him live entirely in his brother's shadow!"" and then left it there. 

i want his story to be better so people could actually relate to it, and actually get something from it.

Power creep would imply that you literally have to use modern Pokémon to win, and that everything before it isn’t good. But this isn’t the case because to even play VGC you need the most recent game, which would have everything on it. Because you are playing a different game, you aren’t experiencing power creep.

Besides, anyone who plays VGC knows that the same core of meta Pokémon is the same from last gen. The only difference is Gholdengo has become apart of it all. We’re gonna trudge though another 3 years of amoogus, garchomp and soon incineroar. Once box cover legendary Pokémon are allowed in VGC everything with be based on Kyogre and Zacian.

But so far some options everyone is leaning towards are Slowbro, Armarouge, and Ceruledge

Slowbro being resistant to fighting and fire. Being bulky, and have type advantage with psychic.

Armarogue and Ceruledge having the flash fire ability, having type advantage over fighting. And both being able to learn psychic moves. While not super bulky, they have the tools to do well assuming the other players can support them

And due to the off chance it having counter. Special attackers would do better

it's the direction i wish GF took Hop & Arven's storylines. it's super damaging to compare yourself to other people constantly, especially as a kid. i think if a pokemon game focused on that as it's narrative, it'd be fantastic to maybe help teach people that it's okay to take your own path, and to take your time getting to milestones. ~~i hope that if a game was like this existed when i was younger, it might have saved me a lot of heartache.~~

In older Pokemon games, there would have definitely been something like that. 

Visiting the game corner and winning some coins, participating in contests, entering a completely silent church, listening to a comically lengthy monologue of a Pokemon Fan Club president, the crime scene in Cerulean City, the Great Marsh, the creepy or gloomy Pokemon Towers or the ancient towers of Johto, battle facilities, ancient ruins etc. Don't you think these sights and places were kinda cool?

If that’s was ""immersion” what was more valuable than cities actual looking like cities where people could live.. well.. I don’t even know what to say to you.

In SV pretty much all of towns are sizeable enough for me to believe what they are inhabited by people what are also always walking around and staying here, eating near cafes or looking for shops, just doing their chores etc. (Pretty often there are even dudes advertising their small shops so they shouting about them nearby) And THIS all giving way more immersion for me personally than being able to walk in building and see exact same interior with exact same npc telling me nothing interesting at all (or even just doing opposite to ”immersion” by breaking fourth wall and telling about game mechanics/buttons etc)

Then again, I might get lots of dislikes here cause I get it what lots of people have lots of complaints about these games, and most of such complaints are 100% reasonable in my opinion. This one however - is not (IMO)",2022-12-19 04:43:23
Comment,2,j0sn50n,,0,1671417795.0,"Except there isn't actually any strategy to choosing when to use the items, since the most warning you have about upcoming content is generally just the type of the gyms, most content in the game has no forecasting. There's very little strategy, because you're just covering your general use situations, which means trying to strategically use single use held items is pointless. You're far better off going with consistent items!

And if you're looking things up anyway, you should be able to easily prepare into a situation where using single use items is a waste.

Having them be used up for the duration of the battle is perfect, as it allows using them with actual concern, instead of constant worry about ""Oh, it got used up on this pointless fight when I could have really used it on the gym leader coming up..."" Now, you can actually use them strategically without having to look anything up ahead of time.",2022-12-19 04:43:15

The problem, is that in between those single episodes of backstory, you have **decades** of 'PrEpArE fOr TrOuBlE' in every single episode, and it's annoying. Detrimental to any kind of story that might be happening, or lasts longer than one episode. 

I don't mind having them show up and try the 'lets steal pikachu' schtick. It's when they do it five hundred times in a row across multiple seasons, in an unbroken chain, that there's a problem. It's not by any means the only problem with the anime, but it IS a part of why Pokemon never ends up on, say, a top ten anime list.",2022-12-19 04:31:23

Comment,2,j0slfmu,,0,1671416970.0,"These are still metaphorical concepts. The established triangle has physical basis that children can see exist in the real world and will have learned. There is logic to the ""hero beats up bad guy"", but it's not as intuitive as there has to be an understanding of good vs evil; which are not physical things a child can relate to as easily. Same with ""brain guy blasts fighting guy"" - you have to understand brain vs brawn. 

""Bad guy tricks brain guy"" doesn't necessarily teach that Dark beats Psychic, because anybody can be tricked. Moreover, Dark beating Psychic usually relates to evil thoughts clouding a strong mind (remember, Dark is Evil in Japan) which, again, is not as intuitive.

I'm not saying you are wrong for the logic presented - I'm just saying that these ideas are not as straightforward for a child to understand versus seeing a reaction in the real world of fire burning a plant and realising the fire made it go away.",2022-12-19 04:29:30

Just a straight line with the bare minimum along the way.

SV was slightly better with it since it's so different, but SwSh really was an embarrasment.

But you're right, I, a customer, should definitely not complain and express displeasure in something that I see in a product that I, a customer, have purchased.

Comment,2,j0siogd,,0,1671415638.0,"Plants absorb water to be able to grow, which I'm certain kids can understand much easier than trying to explain why Dark beats Psychic. We understand why Dark beats Psychic and how Fighting can be super effective on Dark, but to a 5/6 year old I'm not so sure. At that age, I imagine they'd be searching for a ""Light"" type that beats Dark, rather than Fighting. This isn't stuff they would learn in school straight away. 

In contrast, an early-grade Science class would teach you about plants and how they grow; how they absorb water until there's none left. That makes it quite obvious that a plant would be ""strong"" against water.

Whether kids actually care or not is probably not something GameFreak looks at. To them, they need to explain the type triangle every new game. They pick the 3 types that are the easiest to understand why they work the way they do so that the explanation is foolproof, even for a child.

This is where I think you run into problems with the 2 games time traveling in different directions.

As long as its established the time machine only goes 1 way (IE can only go from the present to the past and back or the present to the future and back) this makes sense for Violet since you have to go forward.

But if you can go back in time, as in scarlet why bother getting the Sada AI when you can just save the real Sada?

So you'd have AI Turo and Real Sada. That's going to be a big shift as it relates to Arven.

Meanwhile if you establish either games time machine can go back in time (so you could have real Turo) then Violet suddenly gets past paradox pokemon but scarlet has no reason to get future ones.",2022-12-19 04:03:19

Comment,1,j0shxqa,,0,1671415290.0,"Hi, I'm not sure if you're still interested in this subject, but it's also an interest of mine for which I've been keeping my own spreadsheet. Thanks to your resource here I've added a bunch I didn't know about (mostly from ORAS white flute and Isle Abeens), but I've also found some that my list has but yours does not.

* Kanto Weezing at level 15 can also be obtained by trading for it at the Isle of Armor. Granted getting it in a Safari Ball from HGSS is much cooler
* Marowak can be found at level 12 in Rock Tunnel 1F in Crystal only
* In Sword only, you can find Nuzleaf at level 7 in the Rolling Fields during rain in random grass encounters. By extension, Shiftry is also available at level 7. Unfortunately the same is not true for Lombre in Shield.
* Dusclops at level 16 can also be found in Platinum's Turnback Cave at night
* Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think there's a mistake with Skuntank and Purugly. You need Defog for Purugly to spawn in the Grand Underground or Strength for Skuntank. However, to get either of those you need the second badge. Because of this, their lowest level in BDSP should be 25, which also means Skuntank's overall lowest is 20 from SWSH raids.
* Galarian Darmanitan can be obtained at level 1 since it evolves using an Ice Stone
* Evidently, there are wandering level 20 Toxapex at the Fields of Honor. More accessible than raids

There are also some interesting cases that aren't necessarily underleveled by your definition, but are still not seen at these levels under most circumstances

* Legendary Kanto birds at level 3 in LGPE (yes I'm actually attempting to do this, best so far is level 6 Articuno. Seemingly best spot to hunt for them is the Mt. Moon pokemon center, just going in and out of it. 3 sky spawns per cycle)
* Runerigus and Sirfetch'd at level 1
* Authentic Sinistea and Polteageist cannot be hatched, meaning their lowest level is 15 from Raid Den #193 in the Crown Tundra, 1-star only.

Do you know if the raid trick for level 20s works in SV as well? I haven't been able to confirm that yet since I only have 1 game (and 1 Switch)",2022-12-19 04:01:30

I didn't like X and Y as much, the story wasn't as good and the characters weren't as likeable also as someone who likes to use Pokemon new to the generation i didn't like that there weren't as many new mons either nor were the battles very challenging, for that reason of the 4 titles X and Y would be the one id miss",2022-12-19 03:58:46

Comment,3,j0she7n,,0,1671415031.0,"So I skimmed through each of the videos you linked, and none of them talk about the story much at all - definitely none of them compare it to SwSh. Only one of them seems to talk about the characters in the game, and they're very positive about them for the most part.

One of them seems to just be a general round-up of reviews of the game, which talks about the performance and graphics issues, as well as the bugs and other glitches. Not really much input from the people on the channel. Another is just showing off tweets and reddit posts of glitches.

The ones that do give their opinion basically focus on the three big areas that they're let down by - performance issues and bugs, low-quality graphics and poor world design (both in terms of it feeling lifeless and in terms of progression). I don't disagree with any of these things, but they're nothing to do with SwSh.

The only comparison to SwSh was by the guy that talked about the characters in the game positively, who said that SwSh's gym leaders were also good. Not better than SV, just good.",2022-12-19 03:57:11

Yea sure, GF you wouldn't get as much money if they didn't but that means they don't need to focus on developing a slightly different version of the game at the same time (saving SOME time, but might be worth it seeing SV lmao)
